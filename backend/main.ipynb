      "Based on the provided context, I will answer your question about the OSI model.The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a7-layered framework for designing and implementing network protocols. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a first step toward international standardization of the protocols used in computer networking.Here are the different layers of the OSI model, their functions, and the protocols associated with each layer:### Layer1: Physical Layer [Source: [10]]* Function: Defines the physical means of sending and receiving data between devices.* Protocol: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.### Layer2: Data Link Layer [Source: [9], [10]]* Function: Ensures error-free transfer of data frames between two devices on the same network.* Sublayer:+ MAC (Media Access Control) sublayer [Source: [9]]- Function: Controls access to the physical medium and manages data transmission.- Protocol: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.+ LLC (Logical Link Control) sublayer- Function: Provides error-free transfer of data frames between two devices on the same network.### Layer3: Network Layer [Source: [8], [10]]* Function: Routes data between different networks.* Protocol:+ IP (Internet Protocol)+ ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)### Layer4: Transport Layer [Source: [7], [10]]* Function: Provides reliable data transfer between devices, including error detection and correction.* Protocol:+ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)+ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)### Layer5: Session Layer [Source: [8], [10]]* Function: Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications running on different devices.* Protocol: NetBIOS, SSH, etc.### Layer6: Presentation Layer [Source: [7], [10]]* Function: Converts data into a format that can be understood by the receiving device.* Protocol:+ SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)+ MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)### Layer7: Application Layer [Source: [8], [10]]* Function: Provides services and interfaces for applications running on devices, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.* Protocol:+ HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)+ FTP (File Transfer Protocol)The OSI model provides a clear structure for designing and implementing network protocols, making it easier to understand and troubleshoot network issues.\n"
