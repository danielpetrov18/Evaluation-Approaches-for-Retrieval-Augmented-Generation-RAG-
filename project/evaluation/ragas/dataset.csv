What does it mean to be an ally at GitLab?,"[""The Ally Lab at GitLab provides tools and resources for employees to become allies by taking action to support marginalized groups, going beyond being inclusive. A Sponsor is a senior leader who advocates, elevates, and impacts a team member's opportunities and career progression, while a Sponsee is a team member from an underrepresented group who commits to 9 months in the program. The sponsorship program aims to provide visibility, access to feedback, and intentional talent management for Sponsees, with goals of increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion at GitLab.""]","['What is an ally? A diversity, inclusion and belonging ""ally"" is someone who is willing to take action in support of another person, in order to remove barriers that impede that person from contributing their skills and talents in the workplace or community. Being an ally is a verb, this means that you proactively and purposefully take action and is not something forced upon you. How to be an ally It is not required to be an ally to work at GitLab. At GitLab it is required to be inclusive. Being an ally goes a step beyond being inclusive to taking action to support marginalized groups. The first step in being an ally is self-educating. This ally lab will provide you with some of the tools, resources and learning activities to help you grow as an ally. Skills and Behaviors of allies To be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit. Active listening Neutral and nonjudgmental. Patient (periods of silence are not ""filled"") Verbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring) Asking questions. Reflecting back what is said. Asking for clarification. Summarizing. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence An example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden. Active learning about other experiences You go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened. This could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance. Humility Non-defensive Willingness to take on feedback You aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally. Example of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action. The group will already know you are operating with good intent but generally are wanting to help you level up in their lived experience. Courage Comfortable getting uncomfortable Speak up where others don\'t or can\'t The empathy example is also a good example of this. Self-awareness Own and use your privilege This could look like: You are in a product meeting and the meeting will be making critical decisions about the product roadmap for the next three months and you notice that everyone in the meeting is of the same gender and race. You use your privileged situation in the meeting to point this out and ask the people in the meeting. Who should be invited to ensure we are getting a diverse perspective and viewpoint on the agenda items for the meeting? Action orientated You see something, you say something The example above is a good example of this: Ensure decisions and conversations have diverse voices. I.E. you are in a meeting and everyone looks the same, insist on other perspectives. In a group setting when a discussion or comment is verbalized that could be controversial use language similar to this to course correct the conversation: ""I would like us all to be aware of our language and/or acknowledgements and ensure we are being respectful to all individuals. Thank you."" ""I am practicing being an ally and as a reminder I would like to ensure we are all using inclusive language"" What it means to be an ally Take on the struggle as your own Stand up, even when you feel uncomfortable Transfer the benefits of your privilege to those who lack it Acknowledge that while you, too, feel pain, the conversation is not about you Concepts & Terms Privilege: an unearned advantage given to some people but not all Oppression: systemic inequality present throughout society that benefits people with more privilege and is a disadvantage to those with fewer privileges Ally: a member of a social group that has some privilege, that is working to end oppression and understands their own privilege Power: The ability to control circumstances or access to resources and/or privileges Marginalized groups: a person or group that are treated as unimportant, insignificant or of lower status.

Allyship & Empathy Being an Ally Requires Empathy {{< youtube ""1Evwgu369Jw"" >}} Responding with Empathy What to say, when you don’t know what to say: Acknowledgement of their pain. “I’m sorry you are going through this.” “That must be hard.” Share how you feel. “Wow. I don’t know what to say.” “It makes me really sad to hear this happened.” Show Gratitude that the person opened up. “Thank you for sharing with me.” “This must be hard to talk about. Thanks for opening up to me.” Show Interest. “How are you feeling about everything?” “Is there anything else you want to share?” Be Encouraging. “You are brave / strong / talented.” “You matter.” Be Supportive. “I’m here for you.” “I’m happy to listen any time.” Boot and Sandal Methophor Imagine you are wearing a heavy boot (represents privilege) and you are stepping on someone’s foot that is only wearing sandals (represents oppression). If someone says, “Ouch, you are stepping on my toes!” How do you react? Problems with common responses to mistakes become obvious: Centering the mistake around yourself: “I can’t believe you think I’m a toe-stepper! I’m a good person!” Denial that others’ experiences are different from your own: “I don’t mind when people step on my toes.” Derailing: “Some people don’t even have toes, why aren’t we talking about them instead?” Refusal to center the impacted: “All toes matter!” Tone policing: “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely.” Denial that the problem is fixable: “Toes getting stepped on is a fact of life. You’ll be better off when you accept that.” Victim blaming: “You shouldn’t have been walking around people with boots!” Withdrawing: “I thought you wanted my help, but I guess not. I’ll just go home.” Instead, you would respond with the following: Center the impacted: “Are you okay?” Listen to their response and learn. Apologize for the impact, even though you didn’t intend it: “I’m sorry!” Stop the instance: move your foot Stop the pattern: be careful where you step in the future. When it comes to oppression, we want to actually change the “footwear” to get rid of privilege and oppression (sneakers for all!), but metaphors can only stretch so far!

We have since extended this program to promote pathways for all Sales team members to progress at GitLab. Mentorship vs Sponsorship Harvard Business Review defines the difference between sponsors versus mentors: “While a mentor is someone who has knowledge and will share it with you, a sponsor is a person who has power and will use it for you.” Mentoring is defined in our Mentoring at GitLab handbook page as: Mentor relationships are an opportunity for individuals to learn from someone\'s personal experience, background, and perspective. These relationships build trust on a team, provide safe space to make mistakes, and encourage both personal and professional development. Mentorship is an opportunity for both the mentor and mentee to develop their leadership and communication skills. Mentorship should be led by the mentee, similar to how 1:1\'s at GitLab are driven by direct reports. Sponsorship is defined using influence and/or power to support the growth and development of a team member. A sponsor is typically a senior leader with significant influence and responsibilities. A sponsor will then use this influence to but not limited to; advocating for career advancement opportunities, provide opportunities to upskills via active projects and provide visibility to other senior leaders and the business of the sponsees potential.

"What are some key initiatives to promote diversity, inclusion & belonging in the workplace?","['To establish a diverse, inclusive, and belonging culture, companies should define their terms, evaluate their current DIB landscape through surveys and feedback, and develop a mission statement that aligns with their overall vision. A group or team can be formed to facilitate allyship training and discussions, including sessions on equality strategies, empathy, listening, trust, and commitment statements. Leaders should hold each other accountable for inclusive language and behaviors, avoid identity assumption statements, and ask employees about their pronouns to foster a welcoming environment.']","['Our Values Family and Friends first, Work second Inclusive language and pronouns Parental leave Asynchronous communication and workflows Tips for Companies Defining Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging A great place to begin is to set a foundation of the basic understanding of how your company defines these terms. An example is GitLab\'s Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging value, supported by an evolving list of operating principles. In other places, you may hear them used interchangeably. Understanding their differences is essential to driving the initiatives. As an example, you may hire many diverse candidates, but if you don\'t create an inclusive environment the work can be in vain. Evaluating the company\'s current DIB landscape Consider what you are already doing in this space. What is the current feedback? What are team members saying with company engagement surveys? What are the goals you are wanting to achieve? What are the metrics saying? Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging survey A company survey is a great way to get a sense of team members\' thoughts and concerns. The DIB team at GitLab runs an annual survey via CultureAmp to gauge where we are as a company in terms of diversity, inclusion & belonging. We take the results and implement projects and solutions based on insights from the survey results. Naming this body of work Although Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging are often understood globally, there are other terms that can be leveraged to name your efforts. The naming should be unique to your company. Examples could include Belonging, Inclusion & Collaborations, etc. Developing a mission statement When creating a diverse and inclusive culture, most companies will develop a mission statement to support their vision. Your mission statement should articulate the purpose of your strategy. In a few sentences, you should be able to succinctly provide the why and the how. Be sure to take into account your company’s current overall mission and vision. It is best to align your DIB mission and vision with your organization’s overarching mission and vision. To do this, you may consider how your DIB Strategy can build on, scale, or enhance the organization’s mission and vision. Creating TMRGs In general, TMRGs are an excellent support system and key to providing awareness, respect, and building diversity, inclusion & belonging within the workplace. These groups are a proven way to increase cultural competency, retention of team members, provide marketplace insights to the business, attract diverse talent, and more. The endorsement of TMRGs allows team members to identify common interests and decide how they can be shared with others. When creating TMRGs there are a few initial steps to consider: Creating guidelines to help support TMRGs being stood up within your company Naming of each TMRG Roles within each TMRG Aligning to company strategy Creating forms, Google groups, ways of tracking attendance for TMRG events, and membership metrics Creating a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Advisory Group Consider creating this group as your highest level of global voices: a team of company influencers who can be instrumental in driving DIB efforts from a global perspective. How do you do this? GitLab conducted a global ""All Call"" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide ""why"" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe. Additional support in sustaining the group would be: DIB Advisory group guidelines Appointing an Executive sponsor from the company Designating leads of the group Deciding on when it is time to enact or rotate the opportunity for new advisory group members More to come DIB Initiatives DIB Awards for Recognition DIB Surveys DIB Framework Inclusive Benefits Tips for Managers Set aside time to show up for planned DIB events You may be surprised by how much seeing your face in these events validates this as a worthwhile use of time which is valued by the company. Seeing you in attendance also opens the door to future conversations that might begin with: ""I saw you in XYZ meeting, what did you think of such-and-such topic?"" Incorporate DIB into your team meetings Connecting to team members is key to understand who they are and what they bring to the team. A great initial step is to start with open discussions. You could start by opening your next team meeting to chat about what they feel inclusion looks like, what is important to them as a team to feel included, etc. This could then move into monthly or quarterly team DIB icebreakers, trainings, etc. The idea is to make sure DIB is not touched on once and never mentioned again, but more of an understood aspect of your team environment. You can do this by setting and communicating DIB goals for your team, and sharing how we will measure success (an idea could be sharing DIB survey data with team members). Encourage Diversity of Thought and Speaking Up Don’t assume you know more than others. Give people a chance to add their perspective or expertise. Teach people how to disagree, set the expectation that it is OK to disagree, and encourage people to do it day-to-day. Celebrate diverse thoughts and thank people for making contributions, particularly if they disagree with you. It takes courage to disagree publicly with a leader. Connect with your team members To help team members feel comfortable being themselves, leaders should consider authentic ways to connect to their team members. Everyone wants to feel visible and included in order to perform their best work. Being visible usually includes being seen for accomplishments, acknowledgment of contributions, what is the same, and what differs from team member to team member. Leaders and all team members should show an interest in and respect for differences and contributions.

A diversity, inclusion and belonging ""ally"" is someone who is willing to take action in support of another person, in order to remove barriers that impede that person from contributing their skills and talents in the workplace or community. Being an ally is a verb, this means that you proactively and purposefully take action and is not something forced upon you. How to be an ally It is not required to be an ally to work at GitLab. At GitLab it is required to be inclusive. Being an ally goes a step beyond being inclusive to taking action to support marginalized groups. The first step in being an ally is self-educating. This ally lab will provide you with some of the tools, resources and learning activities to help you grow as an ally. Skills and Behaviors of allies To be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit. Active listening Neutral and nonjudgmental. Patient (periods of silence are not ""filled"") Verbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring) Asking questions. Reflecting back what is said. Asking for clarification. Summarizing. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence An example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden. Active learning about other experiences You go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened. This could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance. Humility Non-defensive Willingness to take on feedback You aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally. Example of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action. The group will already know you are operating with good intent but generally are wanting to help you level up in their lived experience. Courage Comfortable getting uncomfortable Speak up where others don\'t or can\'t The empathy example is also a good example of this. Self-awareness Own and use your privilege This could look like: You are in a product meeting and the meeting will be making critical decisions about the product roadmap for the next three months and you notice that everyone in the meeting is of the same gender and race. You use your privileged situation in the meeting to point this out and ask the people in the meeting. Who should be invited to ensure we are getting a diverse perspective and viewpoint on the agenda items for the meeting? Action orientated You see something, you say something The example above is a good example of this: Ensure decisions and conversations have diverse voices. I.E. you are in a meeting and everyone looks the same, insist on other perspectives. In a group setting when a discussion or comment is verbalized that could be controversial use language similar to this to course correct the conversation: ""I would like us all to be aware of our language and/or acknowledgements and ensure we are being respectful to all individuals. Thank you."" ""I am practicing being an ally and as a reminder I would like to ensure we are all using inclusive language"" What it means to be an ally Take on the struggle as your own Stand up, even when you feel uncomfortable Transfer the benefits of your privilege to those who lack it Acknowledge that while you, too, feel pain, the conversation is not about you Concepts & Terms Privilege: an unearned advantage given to some people but not all Oppression: systemic inequality present throughout society that benefits people with more privilege and is a disadvantage to those with fewer privileges Ally: a member of a social group that has some privilege, that is working to end oppression and understands their own privilege Power: The ability to control circumstances or access to resources and/or privileges Marginalized groups: a person or group that are treated as unimportant, insignificant or of lower status.

Allyship & Empathy Being an Ally Requires Empathy {{< youtube ""1Evwgu369Jw"" >}} Responding with Empathy What to say, when you don’t know what to say: Acknowledgement of their pain. “I’m sorry you are going through this.” “That must be hard.” Share how you feel. “Wow. I don’t know what to say.” “It makes me really sad to hear this happened.” Show Gratitude that the person opened up. “Thank you for sharing with me.” “This must be hard to talk about. Thanks for opening up to me.” Show Interest. “How are you feeling about everything?” “Is there anything else you want to share?” Be Encouraging. “You are brave / strong / talented.” “You matter.” Be Supportive. “I’m here for you.” “I’m happy to listen any time.” Boot and Sandal Methophor Imagine you are wearing a heavy boot (represents privilege) and you are stepping on someone’s foot that is only wearing sandals (represents oppression). If someone says, “Ouch, you are stepping on my toes!” How do you react? Problems with common responses to mistakes become obvious: Centering the mistake around yourself: “I can’t believe you think I’m a toe-stepper! I’m a good person!” Denial that others’ experiences are different from your own: “I don’t mind when people step on my toes.” Derailing: “Some people don’t even have toes, why aren’t we talking about them instead?” Refusal to center the impacted: “All toes matter!” Tone policing: “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely.” Denial that the problem is fixable: “Toes getting stepped on is a fact of life. You’ll be better off when you accept that.” Victim blaming: “You shouldn’t have been walking around people with boots!” Withdrawing: “I thought you wanted my help, but I guess not. I’ll just go home.” Instead, you would respond with the following: Center the impacted: “Are you okay?” Listen to their response and learn. Apologize for the impact, even though you didn’t intend it: “I’m sorry!” Stop the instance: move your foot Stop the pattern: be careful where you step in the future.

Mentorship vs Sponsorship Harvard Business Review defines the difference between sponsors versus mentors: “While a mentor is someone who has knowledge and will share it with you, a sponsor is a person who has power and will use it for you.” Mentoring is defined in our Mentoring at GitLab handbook page as: Mentor relationships are an opportunity for individuals to learn from someone\'s personal experience, background, and perspective. These relationships build trust on a team, provide safe space to make mistakes, and encourage both personal and professional development. Mentorship is an opportunity for both the mentor and mentee to develop their leadership and communication skills. Mentorship should be led by the mentee, similar to how 1:1\'s at GitLab are driven by direct reports. Sponsorship is defined using influence and/or power to support the growth and development of a team member. A sponsor is typically a senior leader with significant influence and responsibilities. A sponsor will then use this influence to but not limited to; advocating for career advancement opportunities, provide opportunities to upskills via active projects and provide visibility to other senior leaders and the business of the sponsees potential.

Suggested Actions: Commit to regular 1-1s Understand the sponsees career development plan Set goals and expectations early Develop You have taken the time to build a relationship with each other, the next step is to develop that relationship by becoming action & capability focussed. In this step the sponsor will help guide the sponsee on areas of improvement in skills & capabilities. The sponsee is responsible for acting on feedback and being intentional about displaying these improvements to the sponsor. Suggested Actions: Find and seek opportunities for the sponsor to observe the sponsees improvement areas Sponsee invites Sponsor to a team meeting where they are presenting Sponsor invites sponsee to a working group Commit This is where both parties agree to move forward with the next step, which is sponsorship and advocating for the sponsee.

GitLab conducted a global ""All Call"" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide ""why"" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe. Additional support in sustaining the group would be: DIB Advisory group guidelines Appointing an Executive sponsor from the company Designating leads of the group Deciding on when it is time to enact or rotate the opportunity for new advisory group members More to come DIB Initiatives DIB Awards for Recognition DIB Surveys DIB Framework Inclusive Benefits Tips for Managers Set aside time to show up for planned DIB events You may be surprised by how much seeing your face in these events validates this as a worthwhile use of time which is valued by the company. Seeing you in attendance also opens the door to future conversations that might begin with: ""I saw you in XYZ meeting, what did you think of such-and-such topic?"" Incorporate DIB into your team meetings Connecting to team members is key to understand who they are and what they bring to the team. A great initial step is to start with open discussions. You could start by opening your next team meeting to chat about what they feel inclusion looks like, what is important to them as a team to feel included, etc. This could then move into monthly or quarterly team DIB icebreakers, trainings, etc. The idea is to make sure DIB is not touched on once and never mentioned again, but more of an understood aspect of your team environment. You can do this by setting and communicating DIB goals for your team, and sharing how we will measure success (an idea could be sharing DIB survey data with team members). Encourage Diversity of Thought and Speaking Up Don’t assume you know more than others. Give people a chance to add their perspective or expertise. Teach people how to disagree, set the expectation that it is OK to disagree, and encourage people to do it day-to-day. Celebrate diverse thoughts and thank people for making contributions, particularly if they disagree with you. It takes courage to disagree publicly with a leader. Connect with your team members To help team members feel comfortable being themselves, leaders should consider authentic ways to connect to their team members. Everyone wants to feel visible and included in order to perform their best work. Being visible usually includes being seen for accomplishments, acknowledgment of contributions, what is the same, and what differs from team member to team member. Leaders and all team members should show an interest in and respect for differences and contributions. Considerations could be that of language/terminology such as “spouses” or “partners” instead of making assumptions about team members sexual orientation.

Looks or names can imply diverse attributes, but they are not perfect identity indicators. Avoid making statements about someone's perceived race, gender, age, ethnicity, or other personal characteristics. When people are typecast or feel misunderstood, they are less likely to feel that they belong. Tip to Uncover Unconscious Bias When you are dealing with a specific situation, you can mentally flip the situation around and see how that feels. For example, flip it from a woman to a man, and if it feels off then you might have a bias.

Allyship & Empathy Being an Ally Requires Empathy {{< youtube ""1Evwgu369Jw"" >}} Responding with Empathy What to say, when you don’t know what to say: Acknowledgement of their pain. “I’m sorry you are going through this.” “That must be hard.” Share how you feel. “Wow. I don’t know what to say.” “It makes me really sad to hear this happened.” Show Gratitude that the person opened up. “Thank you for sharing with me.” “This must be hard to talk about. Thanks for opening up to me.” Show Interest. “How are you feeling about everything?” “Is there anything else you want to share?” Be Encouraging. “You are brave / strong / talented.” “You matter.” Be Supportive. “I’m here for you.” “I’m happy to listen any time.” Boot and Sandal Methophor Imagine you are wearing a heavy boot (represents privilege) and you are stepping on someone’s foot that is only wearing sandals (represents oppression). If someone says, “Ouch, you are stepping on my toes!” How do you react? Problems with common responses to mistakes become obvious: Centering the mistake around yourself: “I can’t believe you think I’m a toe-stepper! I’m a good person!” Denial that others’ experiences are different from your own: “I don’t mind when people step on my toes.” Derailing: “Some people don’t even have toes, why aren’t we talking about them instead?” Refusal to center the impacted: “All toes matter!” Tone policing: “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely.” Denial that the problem is fixable: “Toes getting stepped on is a fact of life. You’ll be better off when you accept that.” Victim blaming: “You shouldn’t have been walking around people with boots!” Withdrawing: “I thought you wanted my help, but I guess not. I’ll just go home.” Instead, you would respond with the following: Center the impacted: “Are you okay?” Listen to their response and learn. Apologize for the impact, even though you didn’t intend it: “I’m sorry!” Stop the instance: move your foot Stop the pattern: be careful where you step in the future.

Effective allyship in the workplace involves active listening, asking questions, reflecting back what is said, and providing verbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening.

Some strategies for effective allyship include:

* Identifying power and privilege
* Following and supporting marginalized groups
* Educating oneself on issues affecting marginalized groups
* Apologizing and correcting mistakes when made
* Leveraging one's own authority to support marginalized individuals

By following these strategies, individuals can build trust and credibility with their colleagues, ultimately increasing their social capital.","Individuals can increase their social capital by being an ally by following the three C's of Consciousness, Courage, and Compassion. This involves being aware of one's own privilege and power, using that power to help others, and showing empathy and understanding towards those who are marginalized or oppressed. In the workplace, effective allyship strategies include recruiting and hiring from diverse backgrounds, providing guidance and support to underrepresented groups, listening and empathizing with their experiences, and taking action to address systemic inequalities.

Click the link for the full activity. The Goals and learning objectives are as follows: To acknowledge and investigate privilege. To provide an opportunity for team members to connect and reflect on the experience of having (or not having) privilege. To discuss the variety of privileges that underrepresented groups have limited access to. Not just legal privileges but social, financial, etc. To discuss how no one privilege is more important than another, that for someone any privilege may feel essential. Team members will be able to identify privileges that they take for granted in their everyday life. Team members will discuss what types of privileges (social, financial, legal, etc.) are important to them and why that may differ from others in their group. Team members will be able to investigate and discuss what groups may have limited access to what privileges and effect that lack of access may have on an individual. In the activity you have a list of privileges, you do not have any of these privileges, for the purpose of this exercise. Roundtable Questions What are some of your most important values? What resonates with you? Share a time when you felt like you were left out or didn’t belong? What are some of the common threads, behaviors that made you feel like this?

We have since extended this program to promote pathways for all Sales team members to progress at GitLab. Mentorship vs Sponsorship Harvard Business Review defines the difference between sponsors versus mentors: “While a mentor is someone who has knowledge and will share it with you, a sponsor is a person who has power and will use it for you.” Mentoring is defined in our Mentoring at GitLab handbook page as: Mentor relationships are an opportunity for individuals to learn from someone\'s personal experience, background, and perspective. These relationships build trust on a team, provide safe space to make mistakes, and encourage both personal and professional development. Mentorship is an opportunity for both the mentor and mentee to develop their leadership and communication skills. Mentorship should be led by the mentee, similar to how 1:1\'s at GitLab are driven by direct reports. Sponsorship is defined using influence and/or power to support the growth and development of a team member. A sponsor is typically a senior leader with significant influence and responsibilities. A sponsor will then use this influence to but not limited to; advocating for career advancement opportunities, provide opportunities to upskills via active projects and provide visibility to other senior leaders and the business of the sponsees potential. Role of a Sponsor at GitLab A Sponsor is someone who has power and influence at GitLab and will use that power to advocate, elevate and impact a team members opportunities and career progression at GitLab. A sponsor at GitLab is: A Senior Leader at a minimum job grade 10+ and is not the sponsees direct manager.

Build Take the time to build a solid relationship with each other. This will be particularly important if you have no previous direct working relationship and can often take some time to cultivate. It is very important to build the relationship first before moving into authentic sponsorship. Suggested Actions: Commit to regular 1-1s Understand the sponsees career development plan Set goals and expectations early Develop You have taken the time to build a relationship with each other, the next step is to develop that relationship by becoming action & capability focussed. In this step the sponsor will help guide the sponsee on areas of improvement in skills & capabilities. The sponsee is responsible for acting on feedback and being intentional about displaying these improvements to the sponsor. Suggested Actions: Find and seek opportunities for the sponsor to observe the sponsees improvement areas Sponsee invites Sponsor to a team meeting where they are presenting Sponsor invites sponsee to a working group Commit This is where both parties agree to move forward with the next step, which is sponsorship and advocating for the sponsee. This can take many forms, such as; a formal discussion, the sponsor outlining actions to the sponsee or at the sponsees request. This is an opportunity to provide feedback, any uncertainties and to reestablish career development goals. Suggested Actions: Participate in feedback session with sponsee Advocate Now that a commitment has been made and the sponsor is satisfied that the sponsee is ready for the next step. The sponsor actively and intentionally advocates for sponsees continued career development and advancement at GitLab.

A diversity, inclusion and belonging ""ally"" is someone who is willing to take action in support of another person, in order to remove barriers that impede that person from contributing their skills and talents in the workplace or community. Being an ally is a verb, this means that you proactively and purposefully take action and is not something forced upon you. How to be an ally It is not required to be an ally to work at GitLab. At GitLab it is required to be inclusive. Being an ally goes a step beyond being inclusive to taking action to support marginalized groups. The first step in being an ally is self-educating. This ally lab will provide you with some of the tools, resources and learning activities to help you grow as an ally. Skills and Behaviors of allies To be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit. Active listening Neutral and nonjudgmental. Patient (periods of silence are not ""filled"") Verbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring) Asking questions. Reflecting back what is said. Asking for clarification. Summarizing. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence An example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden. Active learning about other experiences You go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened. This could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance. Humility Non-defensive Willingness to take on feedback You aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally. Example of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action.

Allyship & Empathy Being an Ally Requires Empathy {{< youtube ""1Evwgu369Jw"" >}} Responding with Empathy What to say, when you don’t know what to say: Acknowledgement of their pain. “I’m sorry you are going through this.” “That must be hard.” Share how you feel. “Wow. I don’t know what to say.” “It makes me really sad to hear this happened.” Show Gratitude that the person opened up. “Thank you for sharing with me.” “This must be hard to talk about. Thanks for opening up to me.” Show Interest. “How are you feeling about everything?” “Is there anything else you want to share?” Be Encouraging. “You are brave / strong / talented.” “You matter.” Be Supportive. “I’m here for you.” “I’m happy to listen any time.” Boot and Sandal Methophor Imagine you are wearing a heavy boot (represents privilege) and you are stepping on someone’s foot that is only wearing sandals (represents oppression). If someone says, “Ouch, you are stepping on my toes!” How do you react? Problems with common responses to mistakes become obvious: Centering the mistake around yourself: “I can’t believe you think I’m a toe-stepper! I’m a good person!” Denial that others’ experiences are different from your own: “I don’t mind when people step on my toes.” Derailing: “Some people don’t even have toes, why aren’t we talking about them instead?” Refusal to center the impacted: “All toes matter!” Tone policing: “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely.” Denial that the problem is fixable: “Toes getting stepped on is a fact of life. You’ll be better off when you accept that.” Victim blaming: “You shouldn’t have been walking around people with boots!” Withdrawing: “I thought you wanted my help, but I guess not. I’ll just go home.” Instead, you would respond with the following: Center the impacted: “Are you okay?” Listen to their response and learn. Apologize for the impact, even though you didn’t intend it: “I’m sorry!” Stop the instance: move your foot Stop the pattern: be careful where you step in the future. When it comes to oppression, we want to actually change the “footwear” to get rid of privilege and oppression (sneakers for all!), but metaphors can only stretch so far!

Key initiatives include DIB Events, DIB Advisory Group, Team Member Resource Groups, and asynchronous communication workflows. The company's CEO emphasizes the importance of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB) in achieving success, with goals including increasing Director+ representation outside of NORAM and promoting global representation of URGs.""]","['<1-hop>\n\nOur Values Family and Friends first, Work second Inclusive language and pronouns Parental leave Asynchronous communication and workflows Tips for Companies Defining Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging A great place to begin is to set a foundation of the basic understanding of how your company defines these terms. An example is GitLab\'s Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging value, supported by an evolving list of operating principles. In other places, you may hear them used interchangeably. Understanding their differences is essential to driving the initiatives. As an example, you may hire many diverse candidates, but if you don\'t create an inclusive environment the work can be in vain. Evaluating the company\'s current DIB landscape Consider what you are already doing in this space. What is the current feedback? What are team members saying with company engagement surveys? What are the goals you are wanting to achieve? What are the metrics saying? Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging survey A company survey is a great way to get a sense of team members\' thoughts and concerns. The DIB team at GitLab runs an annual survey via CultureAmp to gauge where we are as a company in terms of diversity, inclusion & belonging. We take the results and implement projects and solutions based on insights from the survey results. Naming this body of work Although Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging are often understood globally, there are other terms that can be leveraged to name your efforts. The naming should be unique to your company. Examples could include Belonging, Inclusion & Collaborations, etc. Developing a mission statement When creating a diverse and inclusive culture, most companies will develop a mission statement to support their vision. Your mission statement should articulate the purpose of your strategy. In a few sentences, you should be able to succinctly provide the why and the how. Be sure to take into account your company’s current overall mission and vision. It is best to align your DIB mission and vision with your organization’s overarching mission and vision. To do this, you may consider how your DIB Strategy can build on, scale, or enhance the organization’s mission and vision. Creating TMRGs In general, TMRGs are an excellent support system and key to providing awareness, respect, and building diversity, inclusion & belonging within the workplace. These groups are a proven way to increase cultural competency, retention of team members, provide marketplace insights to the business, attract diverse talent, and more. The endorsement of TMRGs allows team members to identify common interests and decide how they can be shared with others. When creating TMRGs there are a few initial steps to consider: Creating guidelines to help support TMRGs being stood up within your company Naming of each TMRG Roles within each TMRG Aligning to company strategy Creating forms, Google groups, ways of tracking attendance for TMRG events, and membership metrics Creating a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Advisory Group Consider creating this group as your highest level of global voices: a team of company influencers who can be instrumental in driving DIB efforts from a global perspective. How do you do this? GitLab conducted a global ""All Call"" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide ""why"" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe. Additional support in sustaining the group would be: DIB Advisory group guidelines Appointing an Executive sponsor from the company Designating leads of the group Deciding on when it is time to enact or rotate the opportunity for new advisory group members More to come DIB Initiatives DIB Awards for Recognition DIB Surveys DIB Framework Inclusive Benefits Tips for Managers Set aside time to show up for planned DIB events You may be surprised by how much seeing your face in these events validates this as a worthwhile use of time which is valued by the company. Seeing you in attendance also opens the door to future conversations that might begin with: ""I saw you in XYZ meeting, what did you think of such-and-such topic?"" Incorporate DIB into your team meetings Connecting to team members is key to understand who they are and what they bring to the team. A great initial step is to start with open discussions. You could start by opening your next team meeting to chat about what they feel inclusion looks like, what is important to them as a team to feel included, etc. This could then move into monthly or quarterly team DIB icebreakers, trainings, etc. The idea is to make sure DIB is not touched on once and never mentioned again, but more of an understood aspect of your team environment. You can do this by setting and communicating DIB goals for your team, and sharing how we will measure success (an idea could be sharing DIB survey data with team members). Encourage Diversity of Thought and Speaking Up Don’t assume you know more than others. Give people a chance to add their perspective or expertise. Teach people how to disagree, set the expectation that it is OK to disagree, and encourage people to do it day-to-day. Celebrate diverse thoughts and thank people for making contributions, particularly if they disagree with you. It takes courage to disagree publicly with a leader. Connect with your team members To help team members feel comfortable being themselves, leaders should consider authentic ways to connect to their team members. Everyone wants to feel visible and included in order to perform their best work. Being visible usually includes being seen for accomplishments, acknowledgment of contributions, what is the same, and what differs from team member to team member.

A diversity, inclusion and belonging ""ally"" is someone who is willing to take action in support of another person, in order to remove barriers that impede that person from contributing their skills and talents in the workplace or community. Being an ally is a verb, this means that you proactively and purposefully take action and is not something forced upon you. How to be an ally It is not required to be an ally to work at GitLab. At GitLab it is required to be inclusive. Being an ally goes a step beyond being inclusive to taking action to support marginalized groups. The first step in being an ally is self-educating. This ally lab will provide you with some of the tools, resources and learning activities to help you grow as an ally. Skills and Behaviors of allies To be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit. Active listening Neutral and nonjudgmental. Patient (periods of silence are not ""filled"") Verbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring) Asking questions. Reflecting back what is said. Asking for clarification. Summarizing. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence An example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden. Active learning about other experiences You go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened. This could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance. Humility Non-defensive Willingness to take on feedback You aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally. Example of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action. The group will already know you are operating with good intent but generally are wanting to help you level up in their lived experience. Courage Comfortable getting uncomfortable Speak up where others don\'t or can\'t The empathy example is also a good example of this. Self-awareness Own and use your privilege This could look like: You are in a product meeting and the meeting will be making critical decisions about the product roadmap for the next three months and you notice that everyone in the meeting is of the same gender and race. You use your privileged situation in the meeting to point this out and ask the people in the meeting. Who should be invited to ensure we are getting a diverse perspective and viewpoint on the agenda items for the meeting? Action orientated You see something, you say something The example above is a good example of this: Ensure decisions and conversations have diverse voices. I.E. you are in a meeting and everyone looks the same, insist on other perspectives. In a group setting when a discussion or comment is verbalized that could be controversial use language similar to this to course correct the conversation: ""I would like us all to be aware of our language and/or acknowledgements and ensure we are being respectful to all individuals. Thank you."" ""I am practicing being an ally and as a reminder I would like to ensure we are all using inclusive language"" What it means to be an ally Take on the struggle as your own Stand up, even when you feel uncomfortable Transfer the benefits of your privilege to those who lack it Acknowledge that while you, too, feel pain, the conversation is not about you Concepts & Terms Privilege: an unearned advantage given to some people but not all Oppression: systemic inequality present throughout society that benefits people with more privilege and is a disadvantage to those with fewer privileges Ally: a member of a social group that has some privilege, that is working to end oppression and understands their own privilege Power: The ability to control circumstances or access to resources and/or privileges Marginalized groups: a person or group that are treated as unimportant, insignificant or of lower status.

An example is GitLab\'s Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging value, supported by an evolving list of operating principles. In other places, you may hear them used interchangeably. Understanding their differences is essential to driving the initiatives. As an example, you may hire many diverse candidates, but if you don\'t create an inclusive environment the work can be in vain. Evaluating the company\'s current DIB landscape Consider what you are already doing in this space. What is the current feedback? What are team members saying with company engagement surveys? What are the goals you are wanting to achieve? What are the metrics saying? Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging survey A company survey is a great way to get a sense of team members\' thoughts and concerns. The DIB team at GitLab runs an annual survey via CultureAmp to gauge where we are as a company in terms of diversity, inclusion & belonging. We take the results and implement projects and solutions based on insights from the survey results. Naming this body of work Although Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging are often understood globally, there are other terms that can be leveraged to name your efforts. The naming should be unique to your company. Examples could include Belonging, Inclusion & Collaborations, etc. Developing a mission statement When creating a diverse and inclusive culture, most companies will develop a mission statement to support their vision. Your mission statement should articulate the purpose of your strategy. In a few sentences, you should be able to succinctly provide the why and the how. Be sure to take into account your company’s current overall mission and vision. It is best to align your DIB mission and vision with your organization’s overarching mission and vision. To do this, you may consider how your DIB Strategy can build on, scale, or enhance the organization’s mission and vision. Creating TMRGs In general, TMRGs are an excellent support system and key to providing awareness, respect, and building diversity, inclusion & belonging within the workplace. These groups are a proven way to increase cultural competency, retention of team members, provide marketplace insights to the business, attract diverse talent, and more. The endorsement of TMRGs allows team members to identify common interests and decide how they can be shared with others. When creating TMRGs there are a few initial steps to consider: Creating guidelines to help support TMRGs being stood up within your company Naming of each TMRG Roles within each TMRG Aligning to company strategy Creating forms, Google groups, ways of tracking attendance for TMRG events, and membership metrics Creating a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Advisory Group Consider creating this group as your highest level of global voices: a team of company influencers who can be instrumental in driving DIB efforts from a global perspective.

GitLab conducted a global ""All Call"" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide ""why"" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe.

You could start by opening your next team meeting to chat about what they feel inclusion looks like, what is important to them as a team to feel included, etc. This could then move into monthly or quarterly team DIB icebreakers, trainings, etc. The idea is to make sure DIB is not touched on once and never mentioned again, but more of an understood aspect of your team environment. You can do this by setting and communicating DIB goals for your team, and sharing how we will measure success (an idea could be sharing DIB survey data with team members). Encourage Diversity of Thought and Speaking Up Don’t assume you know more than others. Give people a chance to add their perspective or expertise. Teach people how to disagree, set the expectation that it is OK to disagree, and encourage people to do it day-to-day. Celebrate diverse thoughts and thank people for making contributions, particularly if they disagree with you. It takes courage to disagree publicly with a leader. Connect with your team members To help team members feel comfortable being themselves, leaders should consider authentic ways to connect to their team members. Everyone wants to feel visible and included in order to perform their best work. Being visible usually includes being seen for accomplishments, acknowledgment of contributions, what is the same, and what differs from team member to team member.

3.  **Team Member Resource Groups (TMRGs)**: Encourage team members to form resource groups focused on fostering DIB within the organization.
4.  **Inclusive language and pronouns**: Promote inclusive language and respect for individual pronouns.
5.  **Asynchronous communication and workflows**: Implement asynchronous communication methods to enable remote work and collaboration across different cultures and backgrounds.
6.  **Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging trainings**: Provide regular training sessions on DIB topics to educate team members.
7.  **Annual survey**: Conduct an annual survey to gauge the company's progress in diversity, inclusion, and belonging.

Firstly, they emphasize the importance of setting clear definitions and understanding of diversity, inclusion, and belonging within their organization. This includes defining these terms in a way that aligns with their company values and mission. Secondly, they conduct regular surveys to gauge team members' thoughts and concerns regarding DIB, using insights from these surveys to inform initiatives and projects.

The company has implemented various initiatives, including Team Member Resource Groups (TMRGs), mentoring programs, and DIB trainings, to foster a culture of inclusion. GitLab's CEO, Sid Sijbrandij, emphasizes the importance of creating a safe space for team members to bring their full selves to work, leading to better decisions and increased sense of belonging. The company has also developed a DIB Roundtable program, which allows teams to discuss and address diversity, inclusion, and belonging issues in a facilitated conversation.""]","['<1-hop>\n\ntitle: ""Sales Sponsorship Pilot Program"" description: ""A page for the Sales Sponsorship Pilot Program"" In 2023 we conducted a pilot program to address an imbalance of Black Team Members at job grade 9+ within Sales and lack of representation in sales leadership positions. The pilot program was designed to create pathways for Black Team Members to progress effectively at GitLab. We have since extended this program to promote pathways for all Sales team members to progress at GitLab. Mentorship vs Sponsorship Harvard Business Review defines the difference between sponsors versus mentors: “While a mentor is someone who has knowledge and will share it with you, a sponsor is a person who has power and will use it for you.” Mentoring is defined in our Mentoring at GitLab handbook page as: Mentor relationships are an opportunity for individuals to learn from someone\'s personal experience, background, and perspective. These relationships build trust on a team, provide safe space to make mistakes, and encourage both personal and professional development. Mentorship is an opportunity for both the mentor and mentee to develop their leadership and communication skills. Mentorship should be led by the mentee, similar to how 1:1\'s at GitLab are driven by direct reports. Sponsorship is defined using influence and/or power to support the growth and development of a team member. A sponsor is typically a senior leader with significant influence and responsibilities. A sponsor will then use this influence to but not limited to; advocating for career advancement opportunities, provide opportunities to upskills via active projects and provide visibility to other senior leaders and the business of the sponsees potential. Role of a Sponsor at GitLab A Sponsor is someone who has power and influence at GitLab and will use that power to advocate, elevate and impact a team members opportunities and career progression at GitLab. A sponsor at GitLab is: A Senior Leader at a minimum job grade 10+ and is not the sponsees direct manager. The senior leader should be a People Manager or Manager of Managers Must have been at GitLab for 6+ months Be able to commit to a 9 month sponsorship program which will include Sponsor Training Kick-off calls Bi-weekly 1-1 with Sponsee Be able to fully commit and be held accountable for their role within the Sponsorship Program As a Sponsor you should be: Be open and honest Listen and Learn Lean into discomfort in areas not familiar to you (e.g. cultural differences) Take risks with the relationship Advocate for your sponsee with intent Give feedback as appropriate Be intentional in building the relationship A sponsor will: Use their influence and power to advocate for the sponsee potential for career advancement Use their influence to increase the visibility of the sponsee amongst other Senior Leaders at GitLab Use their influence to increase the visibility of the sponsee at GitLab Provide opportunities and space for risk-taking and growth Provide feedback on growth and skill development The sponsorship relationship may not provide all the above but the sponsor should be willing and able to provide some of the opportunities above to the sponsor.', '<2-hop>\n\nOur Values Family and Friends first, Work second Inclusive language and pronouns Parental leave Asynchronous communication and workflows Tips for Companies Defining Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging A great place to begin is to set a foundation of the basic understanding of how your company defines these terms.

To provide an opportunity for team members to connect and reflect on the experience of having (or not having) privilege. To discuss the variety of privileges that underrepresented groups have limited access to. Not just legal privileges but social, financial, etc. To discuss how no one privilege is more important than another, that for someone any privilege may feel essential. Team members will be able to identify privileges that they take for granted in their everyday life. Team members will discuss what types of privileges (social, financial, legal, etc.) are important to them and why that may differ from others in their group. Team members will be able to investigate and discuss what groups may have limited access to what privileges and effect that lack of access may have on an individual.

A diversity, inclusion and belonging ""ally"" is someone who is willing to take action in support of another person, in order to remove barriers that impede that person from contributing their skills and talents in the workplace or community. Being an ally is a verb, this means that you proactively and purposefully take action and is not something forced upon you. How to be an ally It is not required to be an ally to work at GitLab. At GitLab it is required to be inclusive. Being an ally goes a step beyond being inclusive to taking action to support marginalized groups. The first step in being an ally is self-educating. This ally lab will provide you with some of the tools, resources and learning activities to help you grow as an ally. Skills and Behaviors of allies To be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit. Active listening Neutral and nonjudgmental. Patient (periods of silence are not ""filled"") Verbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring) Asking questions. Reflecting back what is said. Asking for clarification. Summarizing. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence An example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden. Active learning about other experiences You go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened. This could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance. Humility Non-defensive Willingness to take on feedback You aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally. Example of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action. The group will already know you are operating with good intent but generally are wanting to help you level up in their lived experience. Courage Comfortable getting uncomfortable Speak up where others don\'t or can\'t The empathy example is also a good example of this. Self-awareness Own and use your privilege This could look like: You are in a product meeting and the meeting will be making critical decisions about the product roadmap for the next three months and you notice that everyone in the meeting is of the same gender and race. You use your privileged situation in the meeting to point this out and ask the people in the meeting. Who should be invited to ensure we are getting a diverse perspective and viewpoint on the agenda items for the meeting? Action orientated You see something, you say something The example above is a good example of this: Ensure decisions and conversations have diverse voices. I.E. you are in a meeting and everyone looks the same, insist on other perspectives. In a group setting when a discussion or comment is verbalized that could be controversial use language similar to this to course correct the conversation: ""I would like us all to be aware of our language and/or acknowledgements and ensure we are being respectful to all individuals. Thank you."" ""I am practicing being an ally and as a reminder I would like to ensure we are all using inclusive language"" What it means to be an ally Take on the struggle as your own Stand up, even when you feel uncomfortable Transfer the benefits of your privilege to those who lack it Acknowledge that while you, too, feel pain, the conversation is not about you Concepts & Terms Privilege: an unearned advantage given to some people but not all Oppression: systemic inequality present throughout society that benefits people with more privilege and is a disadvantage to those with fewer privileges Ally: a member of a social group that has some privilege, that is working to end oppression and understands their own privilege Power: The ability to control circumstances or access to resources and/or privileges Marginalized groups: a person or group that are treated as unimportant, insignificant or of lower status. In a workplace setting, employees could be treated as invisible, as if they aren\'t there or their skills or talents are unwelcome or unnecessary Performative allyship: referring to allyship that is done']","The Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging (DIB) Team at GitLab facilitates self-organized DIB Roundtables through a template for opening an issue on their platform.

Click the link for the full activity. The Goals and learning objectives are as follows: To acknowledge and investigate privilege. To provide an opportunity for team members to connect and reflect on the experience of having (or not having) privilege. To discuss the variety of privileges that underrepresented groups have limited access to. Not just legal privileges but social, financial, etc. To discuss how no one privilege is more important than another, that for someone any privilege may feel essential. Team members will be able to identify privileges that they take for granted in their everyday life. Team members will discuss what types of privileges (social, financial, legal, etc.) are important to them and why that may differ from others in their group. Team members will be able to investigate and discuss what groups may have limited access to what privileges and effect that lack of access may have on an individual. In the activity you have a list of privileges, you do not have any of these privileges, for the purpose of this exercise. Roundtable Questions What are some of your most important values? What resonates with you? Share a time when you felt like you were left out or didn’t belong? What are some of the common threads, behaviors that made you feel like this? Share a time where you felt empowered or belonged? What were the actions/behaviors that led to you feel empowered or that you belonged? What does Diversity, Inclusions and Belonging mean to you? Why is it important? What is one thing as a group can we do to make a positive impact on Diversity, Inclusions and Belonging? Once you have fully completed the roundtable, create a handbook entry on the DIB Roundtable Sharing Page. You can share as much or as little as your would like too about the experience and learnings of the roundtable. What next?

An example is GitLab\'s Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging value, supported by an evolving list of operating principles. In other places, you may hear them used interchangeably. Understanding their differences is essential to driving the initiatives. As an example, you may hire many diverse candidates, but if you don\'t create an inclusive environment the work can be in vain. Evaluating the company\'s current DIB landscape Consider what you are already doing in this space. What is the current feedback? What are team members saying with company engagement surveys? What are the goals you are wanting to achieve? What are the metrics saying? Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging survey A company survey is a great way to get a sense of team members\' thoughts and concerns. The DIB team at GitLab runs an annual survey via CultureAmp to gauge where we are as a company in terms of diversity, inclusion & belonging. We take the results and implement projects and solutions based on insights from the survey results. Naming this body of work Although Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging are often understood globally, there are other terms that can be leveraged to name your efforts. The naming should be unique to your company. Examples could include Belonging, Inclusion & Collaborations, etc. Developing a mission statement When creating a diverse and inclusive culture, most companies will develop a mission statement to support their vision. Your mission statement should articulate the purpose of your strategy. In a few sentences, you should be able to succinctly provide the why and the how. Be sure to take into account your company’s current overall mission and vision. It is best to align your DIB mission and vision with your organization’s overarching mission and vision. To do this, you may consider how your DIB Strategy can build on, scale, or enhance the organization’s mission and vision. Creating TMRGs In general, TMRGs are an excellent support system and key to providing awareness, respect, and building diversity, inclusion & belonging within the workplace. These groups are a proven way to increase cultural competency, retention of team members, provide marketplace insights to the business, attract diverse talent, and more. The endorsement of TMRGs allows team members to identify common interests and decide how they can be shared with others. When creating TMRGs there are a few initial steps to consider: Creating guidelines to help support TMRGs being stood up within your company Naming of each TMRG Roles within each TMRG Aligning to company strategy Creating forms, Google groups, ways of tracking attendance for TMRG events, and membership metrics Creating a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Advisory Group Consider creating this group as your highest level of global voices: a team of company influencers who can be instrumental in driving DIB efforts from a global perspective. How do you do this? GitLab conducted a global ""All Call"" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide ""why"" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe. Additional support in sustaining the group would be: DIB Advisory group guidelines Appointing an Executive sponsor from the company Designating leads of the group Deciding on when it is time to enact or rotate the opportunity for new advisory group members More to come DIB Initiatives DIB Awards for Recognition DIB Surveys DIB Framework Inclusive Benefits Tips for Managers Set aside time to show up for planned DIB events You may be surprised by how much seeing your face in these events validates this as a worthwhile use of time which is valued by the company. Seeing you in attendance also opens the door to future conversations that might begin with: ""I saw you in XYZ meeting, what did you think of such-and-such topic?"" Incorporate DIB into your team meetings Connecting to team members is key to understand who they are and what they bring to the team. A great initial step is to start with open discussions. You could start by opening your next team meeting to chat about what they feel inclusion looks like, what is important to them as a team to feel included, etc. This could then move into monthly or quarterly team DIB icebreakers, trainings, etc. The idea is to make sure DIB is not touched on once and never mentioned again, but more of an understood aspect of your team environment. You can do this by setting and communicating DIB goals for your team, and sharing how we will measure success (an idea could be sharing DIB survey data with team members). Encourage Diversity of Thought and Speaking Up Don’t assume you know more than others. Give people a chance to add their perspective or expertise. Teach people how to disagree, set the expectation that it is OK to disagree, and encourage people to do it day-to-day. Celebrate diverse thoughts and thank people for making contributions, particularly if they disagree with you. It takes courage to disagree publicly with a leader. Connect with your team members To help team members feel comfortable being themselves, leaders should consider authentic ways to connect to their team members. Everyone wants to feel visible and included in order to perform their best work. Being visible usually includes being seen for accomplishments, acknowledgment of contributions, what is the same, and what differs from team member to team member. Leaders and all team members should show an interest in and respect for differences and contributions. Considerations could be that of language/terminology such as “spouses” or “partners” instead of making assumptions about team members sexual orientation.

The endorsement of TMRGs allows team members to identify common interests and decide how they can be shared with others. When creating TMRGs there are a few initial steps to consider: Creating guidelines to help support TMRGs being stood up within your company Naming of each TMRG Roles within each TMRG Aligning to company strategy Creating forms, Google groups, ways of tracking attendance for TMRG events, and membership metrics Creating a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Advisory Group Consider creating this group as your highest level of global voices: a team of company influencers who can be instrumental in driving DIB efforts from a global perspective. How do you do this? GitLab conducted a global ""All Call"" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide ""why"" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe. Additional support in sustaining the group would be: DIB Advisory group guidelines Appointing an Executive sponsor from the company Designating leads of the group Deciding on when it is time to enact or rotate the opportunity for new advisory group members More to come DIB Initiatives DIB Awards for Recognition DIB Surveys DIB Framework Inclusive Benefits Tips for Managers Set aside time to show up for planned DIB events You may be surprised by how much seeing your face in these events validates this as a worthwhile use of time which is valued by the company. Seeing you in attendance also opens the door to future conversations that might begin with: ""I saw you in XYZ meeting, what did you think of such-and-such topic?"" Incorporate DIB into your team meetings Connecting to team members is key to understand who they are and what they bring to the team. A great initial step is to start with open discussions. You could start by opening your next team meeting to chat about what they feel inclusion looks like, what is important to them as a team to feel included, etc. This could then move into monthly or quarterly team DIB icebreakers, trainings, etc. The idea is to make sure DIB is not touched on once and never mentioned again, but more of an understood aspect of your team environment. You can do this by setting and communicating DIB goals for your team, and sharing how we will measure success (an idea could be sharing DIB survey data with team members). Encourage Diversity of Thought and Speaking Up Don’t assume you know more than others. Give people a chance to add their perspective or expertise. Teach people how to disagree, set the expectation that it is OK to disagree, and encourage people to do it day-to-day. Celebrate diverse thoughts and thank people for making contributions, particularly if they disagree with you. It takes courage to disagree publicly with a leader. Connect with your team members To help team members feel comfortable being themselves, leaders should consider authentic ways to connect to their team members. Everyone wants to feel visible and included in order to perform their best work. Being visible usually includes being seen for accomplishments, acknowledgment of contributions, what is the same, and what differs from team member to team member. Leaders and all team members should show an interest in and respect for differences and contributions. Considerations could be that of language/terminology such as “spouses” or “partners” instead of making assumptions about team members sexual orientation.

TMRGs play a key role in promoting diversity, inclusion, and belonging by providing awareness, respect, and building diversity within the workplace.

The initial steps to consider when creating TMRGs include:

1. Creating guidelines to support TMRG setup
2. Naming each TMRG
3. Defining roles within each TMRG
4. Aligning with company strategy
5. Establishing forms, Google groups, and tracking attendance for TMRG events","GitLab's DIB strategy incorporates the creation of TMRGs as a key initiative to promote diversity, inclusion, and belonging. TMRGs are support systems that provide awareness, respect, and building diversity, inclusion & belonging within the workplace. They increase cultural competency, retention of team members, provide marketplace insights to the business, attract diverse talent, and more. The DIB team at GitLab runs an annual survey via CultureAmp to gauge where they are as a company in terms of diversity, inclusion & belonging, which informs the creation and development of TMRGs.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
What are some skills and behaviors that effective allies exhibit at GitLab?,"[""GitLab's Ally Lab aims to educate employees on being allies to marginalized groups by taking action, not just being inclusive. Key points include:\n\n* Being an ally is a verb that requires proactive and purposeful action\n* Self-education is the first step in being an ally\n* Inclusive behaviors include active listening, asking questions, and assuming positive intent\n* A successful inclusive environment empowers all team members to contribute and collaborate\n* GitLab's Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB) program includes training materials, sponsorship programs, and measurable outcomes such as increased retention and attraction of underrepresented groups.""]","['<1-hop>\n\nWhat is an ally? A diversity, inclusion and belonging ""ally"" is someone who is willing to take action in support of another person, in order to remove barriers that impede that person from contributing their skills and talents in the workplace or community. Being an ally is a verb, this means that you proactively and purposefully take action and is not something forced upon you. How to be an ally It is not required to be an ally to work at GitLab. At GitLab it is required to be inclusive. Being an ally goes a step beyond being inclusive to taking action to support marginalized groups. The first step in being an ally is self-educating. This ally lab will provide you with some of the tools, resources and learning activities to help you grow as an ally. Skills and Behaviors of allies To be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit. Active listening Neutral and nonjudgmental. Patient (periods of silence are not ""filled"") Verbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring) Asking questions. Reflecting back what is said. Asking for clarification. Summarizing. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence An example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden. Active learning about other experiences You go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened. This could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance. Humility Non-defensive Willingness to take on feedback You aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally. Example of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action. The group will already know you are operating with good intent but generally are wanting to help you level up in their lived experience. Courage Comfortable getting uncomfortable Speak up where others don\'t or can\'t The empathy example is also a good example of this. Self-awareness Own and use your privilege This could look like: You are in a product meeting and the meeting will be making critical decisions about the product roadmap for the next three months and you notice that everyone in the meeting is of the same gender and race. You use your privileged situation in the meeting to point this out and ask the people in the meeting. Who should be invited to ensure we are getting a diverse perspective and viewpoint on the agenda items for the meeting? Action orientated You see something, you say something The example above is a good example of this: Ensure decisions and conversations have diverse voices. I.E. you are in a meeting and everyone looks the same, insist on other perspectives. In a group setting when a discussion or comment is verbalized that could be controversial use language similar to this to course correct the conversation: ""I would like us all to be aware of our language and/or acknowledgements and ensure we are being respectful to all individuals. Thank you."" ""I am practicing being an ally and as a reminder I would like to ensure we are all using inclusive language"" What it means to be an ally Take on the struggle as your own Stand up, even when you feel uncomfortable Transfer the benefits of your privilege to those who lack it Acknowledge that while you, too, feel pain, the conversation is not about you Concepts & Terms Privilege: an unearned advantage given to some people but not all Oppression: systemic inequality present throughout society that benefits people with more privilege and is a disadvantage to those with fewer privileges Ally: a member of a social group that has some privilege, that is working to end oppression and understands their own privilege Power: The ability to control circumstances or access to resources and/or privileges Marginalized groups: a person or group that are treated as unimportant, insignificant or of lower status. In a workplace setting, employees could be treated as invisible, as if they aren\'t there or their skills or talents are unwelcome or unnecessary Performative allyship: referring to allyship that is done', '<2-hop>\n\ntitle: ""Building an Inclusive Remote Culture"" description: "" We are passionate about all remote working and enabling an inclusive work environment.""
