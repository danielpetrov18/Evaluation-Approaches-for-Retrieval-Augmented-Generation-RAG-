      "Question: Did humans evolve from another species or did God create them?\n",
      "Context: The fossil record shows a sequence of ape fossils followed by human fossils with no transitional forms in between, leading some to believe humans evolved from apes. However, this theory remains unproven and inconsistent with biblical accounts of creation, such as Genesis 2:7, which states Adam was formed from dust. The evolution of humans from apes is also disputed among scientists, with many questions remaining about the relationship between Neanderthals, Homo erectus, and modern humans. Humans share nearly 99% of their DNA with chimpanzees, but the common ancestor remains an unproven hypothesis.\n",
      "Answer: The context suggests that there are different perspectives on human evolution. Some sources imply that humans may have evolved from apes, while others propose that God created Adam and Eve as described in the Bible. However, it's also mentioned that the evolution of humans from apes remains an \"unproven scientific theory.\"\n",
      "Refernce Answer: There are two theories surrounding the origin of people: one based on scientific evidence (evolution from apes) and the other based on religion (creation by God). The author believes in the theory of creation, however cannot refute the other one.\n",

      "Question: Why is spending plasma frequently safe, but blood not?\n",
      "Context: Plasma donation myths are being busted by Plasma Heroes, revealing that donating plasma is not bad for one's health, but rather has several benefits such as lowering bad cholesterol and releasing endorphins. The process takes about 90-120 minutes, including a health screening and rest period, and donors are compensated for their time, not the plasma itself. In contrast to whole blood donation, plasma donation has minimal effects on blood chemistry and does not compromise the integrity of the plasma. Plasma treatments help fight cancer, autoimmune psychosis, eye health, and bone growth, among other conditions.\n",
      "Answer: According to the context, frequent plasma donation is considered safe because it takes only 48 hours for the body to replenish the fluid and proteins given, whereas whole blood donation can take 4-8 weeks for the body to replace red blood cells.\n",
      "Refernce Answer: Frequently donating plasma doesn't have any negative health impacts, since the body can replenish the lost fluids and proteins in the matter of 2 days. Donating plasma frequently can even reduce cardiovasciular-diseases.\n",

      "Question: Is 2Pac still alive?\n",
      "Context: Tupac Shakur's death has been shrouded in conspiracy theories for nearly two decades, with some believing he faked his own death. Seven reasons why people still believe Tupac is alive include: no one saw his body after cremation, a photo of him dated September 8, 1996, before Photoshop existed; the posthumous album \"The Don Killuminati\" features an artwork resembling Jesus Christ and rearranged letters spelling out \"Am alive. K.\"; hidden messages in his lyrics suggest he may have been planning to fake his own death; nine albums released after his death raise questions about how he had time to create them; some believe the CIA is hiding him due to his knowledge of sensitive information; and a theory suggests he is living in Cuba with Assata Shakur. These theories have persisted despite the CIA's 2014 denial, fueling ongoing speculation about Tupac's fate.\n",
      "Answer: No, there is no conclusive evidence to confirm Tupac Shakur's survival. The provided sources discuss conspiracy theories surrounding his death but do not provide any credible information suggesting he is still alive.\n",
      "Refernce Answer: Tupak Shakur was shot and shortly after has passed away in 1996 in Las Vegas.\n",

      "Question: Was 9/11 an inside job?\n",
      "Context: A University of Warwick philosopher is exploring why some people believe that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job, with conspiracy theories including controlled demolition of World Trade Center 7. Theories suggest that the building's collapse was evidence of a controlled demolition, but experts argue this explanation doesn't account for the aftermath and hours following the attack. The project aims to understand why people believe in these bizarre conspiracy theories.\n",
      "Answer: Some people believe 9/11 was an inside job due to theories such as controlled demolition of World Trade Center 7, but these claims are not supported by evidence.\n",
      "Refernce Answer: Many of the conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11 have been debunked, one of the most popular ones being - the US-government using explosives to bring down the twin-towers. There hasn't been any conclusive evidence to prove the involvement of the US-government.\n",
