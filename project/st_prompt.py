Prompt engineering can significantly improve the quality of responses.
It's worth trying out different prompts for RAG to see which one works best.
Prompts can be defined in YAML format. Check out the prompts page in the browser.

### About Prompts in R2R

A `prompt` represents a **templated instruction or query pattern** that can be reused across the system for consistent and dynamic interactions.

**Learn more**:
- [R2R Prompt API Docs](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/api-and-sdks/prompts/prompts)
- [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)

---

### Prompt Structure in R2R

Each prompt in R2R consists of **three parts**:

- **`name`**: A unique identifier for the prompt.
- **`template`**: A string defining the structure of the prompt, with placeholders for dynamic content (e.g., `{query}`, `{context}`).
- **`input_types`**: A dictionary specifying the expected input types for each placeholder.

---

### Default Prompts

When you start with R2R, you'll have access to **16 built-in default prompts** designed for various tasks (question answering, summarization, rewriting, etc.). They are internally used by the framework.

For this project, the most relevant is:

- **`rag`** ‚Üí the default Retrieval-Augmented Generation prompt, optimized for injecting retrieved context into LLM responses.

---

**You are encouraged to create your own prompts** to match the specific retrieval and generation behavior you want.
