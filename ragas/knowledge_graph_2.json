However, existing research lacks rigorous\nevaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation\non different large language models, which make it challeng-\ning to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities\nof RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systemati-\ncally investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Gener-\nation on large language models. We analyze the performance\nof different large language models in 4 fundamental abili-\nties required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative\nrejection, information integration, and counterfactual robust-\nness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in\nboth English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within\nthe benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the afore-\nmentioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case.\nThen we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diag-\nnose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG.\nEvaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree\nof noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of\nnegative rejection, information integration, and dealing with\nfalse information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes\nindicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to ef-\nfectively apply RAG to LLMs.\nIntroduction\nRecently, there have been impressive advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) and\nChatGLM (THUDM 2023a). Although these models have\nshown remarkable general abilities (Bang et al. 2023; Guo\net al. 2023), they still suffer severely from challenges includ-\ning factual hallucination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes,\nand Junczys-Dowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023), knowledge out-\ndating (He, Zhang, and Roth 2022), and the lack of domain-\nspecific expertise (Li et al. 2023c; Shen et al. 2023).\nIncorporating external knowledge via information re-\ntrieval, i.e., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), has\nbeen regarded as a promising way to resolve the above chal-\nlenges.

With the help of external knowl-\nedge, LLMs can generate more accurate and reliable re-\nsponses. The most common method is to use a search engine\nas a retriever such as New Bing. Due to the vast amount of\ninformation available on the Internet, using a search engine\ncan provide more real-time information.\nHowever, Retrieval-Augmented Generation brings not\nonly positive effects to LLMs (Liu, Zhang, and Liang 2023;\nMaynez et al. 2020). On one hand, there is a significant\namount of noise information even fake news in the content\navailable on the Internet, which poses challenges for search\nengines in accurately retrieving desirable knowledge. On the\nother hand, LLMs suffer from unreliable generation chal-\nlenge. LLMs can be misled by incorrect information con-\ntained in the context (Bian et al. 2023) and also suffer from\nhallucination during the generation (Adlakha et al. 2023),\nresulting in generating content that goes beyond external in-\narXiv:2309.01431v2  [cs.CL]  20 Dec 2023",

        "page_content": "formation. These challenges result in LLMs being unable to\nconsistently generate reliable and accurate responses. Un-\nfortunately, currently there lacks of comprehensive under-\nstanding on how these factors can influence RAG, and how\ncould each model survives from these drawbacks and im-\nprovement their performance via information retrieval. As a\nresult, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive evalua-\ntion of LLMs on their ability to effectively utilize retrieved\ninformation, as well as their ability to withstand the various\ndrawbacks present in information retrieval.\nTo this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive evalua-\ntion of RAG for current LLMs. Specifically, we create a new\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark, namely RGB,\nin both English and Chinese. In order to ensure that the in-\nternal knowledge of LLMs does not introduce bias into the\nevaluation results, RGB chooses to aggregate the latest news\ninformation and constructs queries based on the news infor-\nmation. Then, based on these queries, we use Search API to\nfetch relevant documents and select most relevant snippets\nfrom the content as external retrieved documents. Finally,\nbased on different compositions of query and document-set\npairs, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to\nevaluate the following basic abilities of LLMs according to\nthe common challenges in RAG, as shown in Figure 1:\n• Noise Robustness, which means a LLM can extract use-\nful information from noisy documents. In this paper, we\ndefine noisy documents as those that are relevant to the\nquestion but do not contain any information of the an-\nswer. For the instance in Figure 1, the noisy documents\nrelated to the question “Who was awarded the 2022 No-\nbel Prize in Literature” include reports about the 2021\nNobel Prize in Literature. To this end, the testbed for\nnoise robustness contains instances whose external doc-\numents contain a certain number of noisy documents\nbased on the desired noise ratio.\n• Negative Rejection, which means that a LLM should re-\nject to answer the question when the required knowledge\nis not present in any retrieved document. The testbed for\nnegative rejection contains instances whose external doc-\numents are only with noisy documents. LLMs are ex-\npected to indicate “insufficient information” or other re-\njection signals.\n• Information Integration , which evaluates whether\nLLMs can answer complex questions that require inte-\ngrating information from multiple documents. For the in-\nstance in Figure 1, for the question “When were the Chat-\nGPT app for iOS and ChatGPT api launched?”, LLMs\nare expected to provide information of the launch dates\nfor both the ChatGPT iOS app and ChatGPT API. The\ntestbed for information integration contains instances\nthat can only be answered using multiple documents.\n• Counterfactual Robustness, which evaluates whether\nLLMs can identify risks of known factual errors in the\nretrieved documents when the LLMs are given warnings\nabout potential risks in the retrieved information through\ninstruction. The testbed for counterfactual robustness in-\ncludes instances that can be answered directly by the\nLLMs, but the external documents contain factual errors.\nBased on RGB, we conduct evaluation on 6 state-of-\nthe-art large language models including ChatGPT (Ope-\nnAI 2022), ChatGLM-6B (THUDM 2023a), ChatGLM2-\n6B (THUDM 2023b), Vicuna-7b (Chiang et al. 2023),\nQwen-7B-Chat (QwenLM 2023), BELLE-7B (Yunjie Ji\n2023). We found that even though RAG can improve the re-\nsponse accuracy of LLMs, they still suffer from the above-\nmentioned challenges significantly. Specifically, we found\nthat even though LLMs demonstrate some level of noise ro-\nbustness, they tend to confuse similar information and fre-\nquently generate inaccurate answers when relevant informa-\ntion exists. For example, when faced with a question about\nthe 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature, if there are noisy docu-\nments about the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature in external\ndocuments, LLMs may become confused and provide inac-\ncurate answers. Besides, LLMs frequently fail to reject an-\nswering and generate incorrect answers when none of the\nexternal documents contain relevant information. Further-\nmore, LLMs lack the ability to summarize from multiple\ndocuments, and therefore if multiple documents are needed\nto answer a question, LLMs often fail to provide accurate\nanswer. Finally, we found that even when the LLMs contain\nthe required knowledge and are given warnings about po-\ntential risks in the retrieved information through instruction,\nthey still tend to trust and prioritize the retrieved information\nover their own existing knowledge. The experimental results\nmentioned above highlight the need for further resolution of\nimportant issues in the existing RAG method. Therefore, it\nis crucial to exercise caution and carefully design its usage.\nGenerally speaking, the contributions of this paper are1:\n• We proposed to evaluate four capabilities for retrieval-\naugmented generation of LLMs and created the\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark in both En-\nglish and Chinese. To best of our knowledge, it is the first\nbenchmark designed to assess these four capabilities for\nretrieval-augmented generation of LLMs.\n• We evaluated the existing LLMs using RGB and found\nthe limitations of them in the four different abilities.\n• We analyzed the responses of LLMs in RGB and identi-\nfied their current shortcomings as well as suggested di-\nrections for improvement.\nRelated work\nRetrieval-augmented models The knowledge stored in\nlarge language models is commonly out-of-date (He, Zhang,\nand Roth 2022) and they also sometimes generate hallu-\ncination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes, and Junczys-\nDowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023) i.e., they may generate ir-\nrelevant or factually incorrect contents. By using external\nknowledge as guidance, retrieval-augmented models can\ngenerate more accurate and reliable responses (Guu et al.\n2020; Lewis et al. 2020; Borgeaud et al. 2022; Izacard\net al. 2022; Shi et al. 2023; Ren et al. 2023). Retrieval-\naugmented models have achieved remarkable results in var-\nious tasks such as open-domain QA (Izacard and Grave\n2021; Trivedi et al. 2023; Li et al. 2023a), dialogue (Cai\n1Our code&data: https://github.com/chen700564/RGB.",

Recently, with the development of large mod-\nels, a series of retrieval-enhanced tools and products have\ngained widespread attention, such as ChatGPT retrieval plu-\ngin, Langchain, New Bing, etc. However, in real-world sce-\nnarios, the retrieved text inevitably contains noise. There-\nfore, in this paper we conducted a systematic evaluation and\nanalysis of retrieval-augmented generation in LLMs.\nEvaluation of LLMs Evaluating LLMs has received sig-\nnificant attention due to their remarkable general capabil-\nity (Chang et al. 2023). It enables us to gain a deeper under-\nstanding of the specific abilities and limitations of LLMs,\nwhile also providing valuable guidance for future research.\nIn the past, benchmarks such as GLUE (Wang et al. 2019b)\nand SuperCLUE (Wang et al. 2019a) primarily focused on\nevaluating NLP tasks, particularly in natural language un-\nderstanding. However, these evaluations often fail to fully\ncapture the capabilities of LLMs. MMLU (Hendrycks et al.\n2021) was then proposed to measure the knowledge acquired\nby language models when pre-training. Recently, with the\ndevelopment of LLMs, a series of general evaluation bench-\nmarks have emerged, such as AGIEval (Zhong et al. 2023),\nC-Eval (Huang et al. 2023), AlpacaEval (Li et al. 2023b),\nOpenLLM Leaderboard (Edward Beeching 2023), etc. In\naddition to general abilities, there are also specific bench-\nmarks that focus on evaluating the capabilities of models.\nFor example, CValues (Xu et al. 2023a) focuses on the safety\nand responsibility of LLMs, M3Exam (Zhang et al. 2023)\nfocuses on human exam and ToolBench (Qin et al. 2023)\nevaluates how well LLMs use external tools. Recently, Ad-\nlakha et al. (2023) evaluate the RAG of LLMs in exist QA\ndataset. Different from their work, we focus on 4 required\nabilities of RAG and create Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion Benchmark to evaluate the LLMs.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark\nIn this section, we first introduce the specific retrieval-\naugmented generation abilities we aim to evaluate. Next, we\noutline the process of constructing the RAG benchmark for\nevaluation. Lastly, we present the evaluation metrics.\nRequired abilities of RAG\nExternal knowledge is the key to resolving the problems\nof LLMs such as hallucination and outdated knowledge,\nwhich can make LLMs generate more accurate and reliable\nresponses through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nHowever, LLMs cannot always response as expected with\nRAG. For one thing, there are numerous irrelevant docu-\nments and false information on the Internet. Incorporating\nthese external documents into LLMs could have a detrimen-\ntal effect. For anthoer, LLMs suffer from the unreliable gen-\neration challenge. The generation of LLMs is often unpre-\ndictable, and we cannot guarantee that they will utilize the\nuseful information entailed in the external documents. Ad-\nditionally, LLMs can easily be misled by incorrect infor-\nmation in the document. To this end, we build Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation Benchmark (RGB) to evaluate the\nretrieval-augmented generation of LLMs, and we concern\nabout 4 specific abilities:\nNoise Robustness is the robustness of LLMs in noisy\ndocuments. As retrievers are not perfect, the external knowl-\nedge they retrieve often contains a significant amount of\nnoise, i.e., documents which are relevant to the question but\ndo not contain any information about the answer. To effec-\ntively answer user questions, LLMs must be able to extract\nthe necessary information from documents despite there are\nnoisy documents.\nNegative Rejectionis a measure of whether LLMs can\ndecline to answer a question when none of the contexts pro-\nvide useful information. In real-world situations, the search\nengine often fails to retrieve documents containing the an-\nswers. In these cases, it is important for the model to have\nthe capability to reject recognition and avoid generating mis-\nleading content.\nInformation Integration is a capacity to integrate an-\nswers from multiple documents. In many cases, the an-\nswer to a question may be contained in multiple documents.\nFor example, for the question “Who are the champions of\nthe U.S. Open 2022 men’s and women’s singles?”, the two\nchampions may be mentioned in different documents. In or-\nder to provide better answers to complex questions, it is nec-\nessary for LLMs to have the ability to integrate information.\nCounterfactual Robustnessrefers to a capacity to han-\ndle errors in external knowledge. In the real world, there is\nan abundance of false information on the internet. Please",

We evaluate the\nLLMs by judging the retrieval-augmented responses of them\nto the questions. To simulate real-world scenarios, we con-\nstruct question and answer data using actual news articles.\nDue to the abundance of knowledge contained within the\nLLMs there is a potential for bias when measuring the first\nthree abilities. To mitigate this, the instances of RGB are\nconstructed by latest news articles. Additionally, we retrieve\nexternal documents from Internet through search engines.\nFinally, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds\nto evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. The overall\nprocedure of our data construction is illustrated in Figure 2.\nQA instances generation.We first collect latest news ar-\nticles and use prompts to make ChatGPT generate events,\nquestions, and answers for each articles. For example, as\nshown in the Figure 2, for a report about “The 2022 Nobel\nPrize”, ChatGPT will generate corresponding event, ques-\ntion and provide key information for answering it. By gen-\nerating events, the model is able to preliminarily filter out\nnews articles that do not contain any events. After genera-\ntion, we manually check the answer and filter out data that\nis difficult to retrieve through search engines.\nRetrieve using search engine.For each query, we use\nGoogle’s API to fetch 10 relevant web pages and extract\ncorresponding snippets of text from them. Simultaneously,\nwe read these web pages and convert their textual content\ninto text chunks with a maximum length of 300 tokens. Us-\ning an existing dense retrieval model 2, we select the top-30\ntext chunks that match the query most effectively. These re-\ntrieved text chunks, along with the snippets provided by the\nsearch API, will serve as our external documents. These doc-\numents will be divided into positive documents and negative\ndocuments based on whether they contain the answer.\nTestbeds construction for each ability.We expand the\ncorpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above\nbasic abilities of LLMs. To evaluate the noise robustness,\nwe sample varying numbers of negative documents ac-\ncording to the desired ratio of noises. For negative rejec-\ntion, all the external documents are sampled from negative\ndocuments. For the information integration ability, we fur-\nther construct data based on the above generated questions.\nThis involves expanding or rewriting these questions so that\ntheir answers encompass multiple aspects. For example, the\nquestion “Who won the MVP of Super Bowl 2023?” can\nbe rewrite as “Who won the MVPs of Super Bowl 2022\nand 2023?”.

Dif-\nferent from the first three abilities, the data of counterfactual\nrobustness is constructed solely based on the internal knowl-\nedge of the model. Based on the aforementioned generated\nquestions mentioned above, we adopt ChatGPT to automat-\nically generate its known knowledge. Specifically, we use\nprompts to allow the model to generate both questions and\nanswers that are already known. For example, based on the\nquestion “Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Phys-\niology and Medicine?”, the model will generate the known\nquestion “Who was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Lit-\nerature?” and answer “ Abdulrazak Gurnah”. We then man-\nually verified the generated answers, and retrieve relevant\ndocuments as described above. In order to make documents\ncontain factual errors, we manually modify the answers and\nreplace the corresponding parts in the document.\nFinally, we collect totally 600 base questions in RGB,\nand 200 additional questions for the information integration\nability and 200 additional questions for counterfactual ro-\nbustness ability. Half of the instances are in English, and the\nother half are in Chinese.\nEvaluation metrics\nThe core of this benchmark is to evaluate whether LLMs can\nutilize the provided external documents to acquire knowl-\nedge and generate reasonable answers. We evaluate the re-\nsponses of LLMs in order to measure above-mentioned four\nabilities of them.\nAccuracy is used to measure noise robustness and infor-\nmation integration. We employ an exact matching approach\nwhere if the generated text contains an exact match to the\nanswer, it is considered as a correct answer.\nRejection rate is used to measure negative rejection.\nWhen only noisy documents are provided, LLMs should\noutput the specific content – “I can not answer the question\nbecause of the insufficient information in documents.” (We\nuse instructions to inform the model.). If the model gener-\nates this content, it indicates a successful rejection.\nError detection ratemeasures whether the model can\ndetect the factual errors in the documents for counterfactual\nrobustness. When the provided documents contain factual\nerrors, the model should output the specific content – “There\nare factual errors in the provided documents.” (We use in-",

The model is asked to generate the cor-\nrect answer after identifying the factual errors. If the model\ngenerates the correct answer, it indicates that the model is\ncapable of correcting errors in the document.\nConsidering that the model may not fully adhere to in-\nstructions, for rejection rate and error detection rate, we\nalso use ChatGPT to conduct additional evaluation of the\nanswers. Specifically, we assess the model’s responses by\nusing instructions and demonstrations to determine if they\ncan reflect information that is not present in the document or\nidentify any factual errors.\nExperiments\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of various\nLLMs, analyze and discuss the results, summarizing the\nmain challenges that existing LLMs encounter when using\nexternal knowledge.\nSettings\nTask formats.Due to contextual limitations, we provide 5\nexternal documents for each question. In our experiments\non noise robustness, we evaluate scenarios with noise ra-\ntios ranging from 0 to 0.8. To comprehensively evaluate the\noverall capabilities, we have adopted a unified instruction\nfor each language, as shown in Figure 3. The experiments\nwere conducted using an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090.\nModels We conduct evaluation on 6 state-of-the-art\nlarge language models which can generate both En-\nglish and Chinese including ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) 3,\nChatGLM-6B (THUDM 2023a), ChatGLM2-6B (THUDM\n2023b), Vicuna-7b-v1.3 (Chiang et al. 2023), Qwen-7B-\nChat (QwenLM 2023), BELLE-7B-2M (Yunjie Ji 2023).\nResults on Noise Robustness\nWe evaluated the accuracy based on the different noise ratios\nin external documents, and the results are shown in Table 1.\nWe can see that:\n(1) RAG can effect improve the responses of LLMs.\nLLMs have shown strong performance even in the presence\nof noise, indicating that RAG is a promising way for LLMs\nto generate accurate and reliable responses.\n(2) The increasing noise rate poses a challenge for\nRAG in LLMs.Specifically, when the noise ratio exceeds\n80%, the accuracy decreases significantly at a significance\nlevel of 0.05. For example, the performance of ChatGPT has\ndecreased from 96.33% to 76.00%, while the performance\nof ChatGLM2-6B has decreased from 91.33% to 57.33%.\nError Analysis. To better comprehend the negative im-\npact of noise on model generation, we examined the incor-\nrect answers and found that these errors typically originate\nfrom three reasons, as shown in Table 2.\n(1) Long-distance information.LLMs often face diffi-\nculty in identifying the correct answer from external docu-\nments when the information related to the question is distant\nfrom the information related to the answer. This scenario\nis quite common as longer texts are frequently encountered\n3We use gpt-3.5-turbo api in the experiments.",

The experiment evaluates LLMs' ability to generate accurate responses when faced with noisy external documents. The results show that RAG can improve the responses of LLMs, but increasing noise rate poses a challenge for RAG in LLMs. Specifically, when the noise ratio exceeds 80%, the accuracy decreases significantly. The errors typically originate from three reasons: long-distance information, evidence uncertainty, and concept confusion.",

        "page_content": "on the internet. In such cases, it is typical for the question’s\ninformation to be initially presented at the start of the doc-\nument and subsequently referred to using pronouns. In Ta-\nble 2, the question information (“Qatar Open 2022”) is only\nmentioned once at the beginning and is far from where the\nanswer text “Anett Kontaveit” appears. This situation may\ncause LLMs to depend on information from other docu-\nments and create false impressions, i.e., hallucination.\n(2) Evidence uncertainty. Before highly anticipated\nevents, like the release of new Apple products or the an-\nnouncement of the Oscars, there is often a significant\namount of speculative information circulating on the inter-\nnet. Although the relevant documents explicitly state that\nit is uncertain or speculative content, they can still impact\non the retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs. In Table 2,\nwhen the noise ratio increases, the content of erroneous\ndocuments is all about some people’s predictions about the\nname of the headset (“Apple Reality Pro”). Even if there is\na correct answer (“Vision Pro”) in the relevant documents,\nLLMs can still be misled by uncertain evidences.\n(3) Concept confusion.The concepts in external docu-\nments may be similar to, but different from, the concepts in\nthe question. This can cause confusion for LLMs and make\nLLMs generate incorrect answers. In Table 2, the model an-\nswer focuses on the concept “automotive revenue” in the\ndocument rather than “revenue” in the question.\nBased on the analysis above, we have identified certain\nlimitations in LLMs regarding retrieval-augmented genera-\ntion. To effectively handle the vast amount of noise present\non the internet, further detailed enhancements are required\nfor the model such as long documents modeling and precise\nconcept comprehension.\nResults on Negative Rejection testbed\nWe evaluated the rejection rate when only noise documents\nwere provided. The results are shown in Table 3. In addi-\ntion to evaluating the rejection rate through exact matching\n(Rej in Table 3), we also utilize ChatGPT to determine if\nthe responses from the LLMs contain any rejection informa-\ntion (Rej∗ in Table 3). We can see that: Negative Rejection\nposes a challenge for RAG in LLMs.The highest rejection\nrates for LLMs in English and Chinese were only 45% and\n43.33%, respectively. This suggests that LLMs can be easily\nmisled by noisy documents, leading to incorrect answers.\nIn addition, through comparing Rej and Rej ∗, we found\nthat LLMs fail to strictly follow instructions, and they often\ngenerate unpredictable responses, which make it hard to use\nthem as state triggers (such as for recognizing rejection).\nWe conduct case studies in Table 4. The first error is\nbecause of Evidence uncertainty. Although the document\nonly mentions contact with “Adam McKay” and does not\nexplicitly state that he is the director of the movie, the\nmodel still concludes that he holds this role. The first er-\nror is because of Concept confusion. The information pro-\nvided in the answer pertains to “the 2018 Winter Olympics”\ninstead of “the 2022 Olympics” mentioned in the question.\nRetrieval-augmented generation poses a greater challenge of\nnegative rejection compared to answer directly as it presents\nrelevant documents that could potentially mislead the LLMs\nLanguages English Chinese\nRej Rej ∗ Rej Rej ∗\nChatGPT 24.67 45.00 5.33 43.33\nChatGLM-6B 9.00 25.00 6.33 17.00\nChatGLM2-6B10.33 41.33 6.33 36.33\nVicuna-7B-v1.317.00 33.33 3.37 24.67\nQwen-7B-Chat31.00 35.67 8.67 25.33\nBELLE-7B-2M5.67 32.33 5.33 13.67\nTable 3: The result of negative rejection. Rej means the re-\njection rate (%) and Rej∗ means the rejection rate evaluated\nby ChatGPT. We can see that negative rejection poses a chal-\nlenge for RAG in LLMs.\nQuestion Answer Response\nwho will directIrredeemable film?JeymesSamuel\nThe information provided in the documentis that Fox has attached “The Big Short”writer-director Adam McKay to its movieadaptation of “Irredeemable” from Boom!Comics. Therefore, the answer is Adam McKay.\nWhich country won themost medals at the2022 Winter Olympics?Norway\nBased on the information provided in thedocument, the country that won the most medalsat the 2022 Winter Olympics is Germany.Germany has won a total of 31 medals, including 14gold medals, 14 bronze medals, and 31 silver medals.\nTable 4: Error cases of negative rejection generated by\nChatGLM2-6B. The red text highlights the error answers.\nand result in incorrect responses. In future developments, it\nwill be crucial for LLMs to enhance their ability to accu-\nrately match questions with the appropriate documents.\nResults on Information Integration testbed\nWe evaluated the accuracy based on the different noise ratios\nin external documents, and the results are shown in Table 5.\nWhen comparing the model to Table 1, we observed that\nit has a weak information integration ability, which in turn\naffects its noise robustness. We can see that:\n(1) Information integration poses a challenge for RAG\nin LLMs.Even without noise, the highest accuracy of LLMs\ncan only reach 60% and 67% for English and Chinese,\nrespectively. After adding noise, the highest accuracy de-\ncreases to 43% and 55%. These results suggest that LLMs\nstruggle with integrating information effectively and are not\nwell-suited for directly answering complex questions.\n(2) Complex questions are more challenging for RAG\nwith noisy documents.Performance decline becomes sig-\nnificant when the noise ratio is 0.4, but for simple problems,\na significant decline occurs only at a noise ratio of 0.8 at a\nsignificance level of 0.05. This indicates that complex prob-\nlems are more vulnerable to interference from noise. We\nspeculate that this is because solving complex problems re-\nquires integrating information from multiple documents, and\nthis information can be considered as noise to each other,\nmaking it harder for the model to extract relevant informa-\ntion from the documents.\nError Analysis. We conducted an error analysis on\nChatGLM2-6B (noise ratio is 0). Apart from the similar er-\nrors founded in the noise robustness experiment (38% of the\ntotal), there are also three types of unique errors. We have\npresented these cases in Table 6.",

The blue and red\ntexts represent the answers to two sub-questions.\n(1) Merging Error (28% of the total).The model some-\ntimes merges the answers of the two sub-questions, resulting\nin an error. It mistakenly uses the answer from one question\nto address both two questions. At this point, the model will\ndisregard any documents related to one sub-question. For\nexample, in Table 6, it incorrectly states that Group D is the\nWorld Cup group for both France and Germany, while in fact\nGermany is actually assigned to Group E.\n(2) Ignoring Error (28% of the total).Sometimes, the\nmodel may ignore one of the sub-questions and only answer\nthe other. This error occurs when the model lacks a complete\nunderstanding of the problem and fails to recognize that it\nconsists of multiple sub-problems. As a result, the model\nonly considers relevant documents for one sub-problem in\norder to generate an answer, disregarding the question posed\nby another sub-problem. For example, in Table 6, the model\nonly provides the answer for the MVP of Super Bowl 2022\nand does not consider 2023.\n(3) Misalignment Error (6% of the total).Sometimes,\nthe model incorrectly identifies the documents for one sub-\nquestion as the documents for another sub-question, leading\nto misaligned answers. For example, in Table 6, the third an-\nswer has two errors: an ignoring error and a misalignment er-\nror. Firstly, the model only mentioned the Best Picture of the\n2023 (95th) Academy Awards, completely disregarding the\n2022 awards. Additionally, it incorrectly stated that “CODA”\nis the Best Picture of 2023 when it was actually awarded as\nthe Best Picture in 2022.\nThe errors mentioned above are primarily caused by the\nlimited understanding of complex questions, which hinders\nthe ability to effectively utilize information from different\nsub-problems. The key lies in improving the model’s rea-\nsoning capability.

CR is the error cor-\nrection rate.\nthought approach to break down complex problems (Zhou\net al. 2023a; Xu et al. 2023b; Drozdov et al. 2023). How-\never, these methods slow down the inference speed and can-\nnot provide timely responses.\nResults on Counterfactual Robustness testbed\nIn order to ensure that LLMs possess relevant knowledge,\nwe assess their performance by directly asking them ques-\ntions. However, we found that most LLMs struggle to an-\nswer them correctly. To ensure a more reasonable evalua-\ntion, we only consider LLMs that have an accuracy rate of\nover 70% as this threshold is relatively high and encom-\npasses more LLMs. The results are shown in Table 7. We\npresent the following metrics: accuracy without any docu-\nments, accuracy with counterfactual documents, error de-\ntection rates, and error correction rates. We can see that It\nis hard for LLMs to identify and correct factual errors in the\ndocuments. This suggests that the model can be easily mis-\nled by documents containing incorrect facts.\nIt is important to note that retrieval-augmented generation\nis not designed to automatically address factual errors within\na given context, as this contradicts the underlying assump-\ntion that the model lacks knowledge and relies on retrieved\ndocuments for additional information. However, this issue is\ncrucial in practical applications due to the abundance of fake\nnews on the internet. Existing LLMs do not have a safeguard\nto handle inaccurate responses caused by misinformation. In\nfact, they heavily depend on the information they retrieve.\nEven when LLMs contain the internal knowledge about the\nquestions, they often trust false information that is retrieved.\nThis presents significant a challenge for the future develop-\nment of RAG in LLMs.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we evaluated four abilities of retrieval-\naugmented generation in LLMs: noise robustness, nega-\ntive rejection, information integration, and counterfactual\nrobustness. To conduct the evaluation, we built Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation Benchmark (RGB). The instances of\nRGB are generated from latest news articles and the external\ndocuments obtained from search engines. The experimental\nresults suggest that current LLMs have limitations in the 4\nabilities. This indicates that there is still a significant amount\nof work needed to effectively apply RAG to LLMs. To en-\nsure accurate and reliable responses from LLMs, it is crucial\nto exercise caution and carefully design for RAG.",

        "page_content": "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nsatoshin@gmx.com\nwww.bitcoin.org\nAbstract.  A purely peer-to-peer version of  electronic cash would allow online  \npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a  \nfinancial institution.  Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main  \nbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.  \nWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. \nThe network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of  \nhash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing  \nthe proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of  \nevents witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.  As  \nlong as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to  \nattack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  The  \nnetwork itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are broadcast on a best effort  \nbasis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest  \nproof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.\n1. Introduction\nCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as  \ntrusted third parties to process electronic payments.  While the system works well enough for  \nmost  transactions,  it  still  suffers  from  the  inherent  weaknesses  of  the  trust  based  model.  \nCompletely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot  \navoid  mediating  disputes.   The  cost  of  mediation  increases  transaction  costs,  limiting  the  \nminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,  \nand there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-\nreversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must  \nbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.  \nA certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties  \ncan be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments  \nover a communications channel without a trusted party.\nWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,  \nallowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted  \nthird party.  Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers  \nfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.  In  \nthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed  \ntimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The  \nsystem  is  secure  as  long  as  honest  nodes  collectively  control  more  CPU  power  than  any  \ncooperating group of attacker nodes.\n1",

Each owner transfers the coin to the  \nnext by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner  \nand adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of  \nownership.\nThe problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend  \nthe coin.  A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every \ntransaction for double spending.  After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to  \nissue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.  \nThe  problem with  this solution  is that  the  fate of the entire  money system depends on the  \ncompany running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.\nWe need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier  \ntransactions.  For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care  \nabout later attempts to double-spend.  The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to  \nbe aware of all transactions.  In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and  \ndecided which arrived first.  To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be  \npublicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the  \norder in which they were received.  The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the \nmajority of nodes agreed it was the first received. \n3. Timestamp Server\nThe solution we propose begins with a timestamp server.  A timestamp server works by taking a  \nhash  of a  block  of  items  to  be  timestamped  and  widely  publishing  the  hash,  such  as  in  a  \nnewspaper or Usenet post [2-5].  The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the  \ntime, obviously, in order to get into the hash.  Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in  \nits hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.\n2\nBlock\nItem Item ...\nHash\nBlock\nItem Item ...\nHash\nTransaction\nOwner 1's\nPublic Key\nOwner 0's\nSignature\nHash\nTransaction\nOwner 2's\nPublic Key\nOwner 1's\nSignature\nHash\n Verify\nTransaction\nOwner 3's\nPublic Key\nOwner 2's\nSignature\nHash\n Verify\nOwner 2's\nPrivate Key\nOwner 1's\nPrivate Key\nSign  Sign  \nOwner 3's\nPrivate Key",

Proof-of-Work\nTo implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-\nof-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.  \nThe proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the  \nhash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number  \nof zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.\nFor our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the  \nblock until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.  Once the CPU  \neffort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed  \nwithout redoing the work.  As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block  \nwould include redoing all the blocks after it.\nThe proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision  \nmaking.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone  \nable  to  allocate  many  IPs.   Proof-of-work  is  essentially  one-CPU-one-vote.   The  majority  \ndecision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested  \nin it.  If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the  \nfastest and outpace any competing chains.  To modify a past block, an attacker would have to  \nredo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the  \nwork of the honest nodes.  We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up \ndiminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.\nTo compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, \nthe proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of  \nblocks per hour.  If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.\n5. Network\nThe steps to run the network are as follows:\n1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\n2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.  \n3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.\n4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\n5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.\n6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the  \nchain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.\nNodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on  \nextending it.  If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some  \nnodes may receive one or the other first.  In that case, they work on the first one they received,  \nbut save the other branch in case it becomes longer.  The tie will be broken when the next proof-\nof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other  \nbranch will then switch to the longer one.\n3\nBlock\nPrev Hash Nonce\nTx Tx ...\nBlock\nPrev Hash Nonce\nTx Tx ...",

        "page_content": "New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes.  As long as they reach  \nmany nodes, they will get into a block before long.  Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped  \nmessages.  If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and \nrealizes it missed one.\n6. Incentive\nBy convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned \nby the creator of the block.  This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides \na way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.  \nThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending  \nresources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\nThe incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is  \nless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of  \nthe  block  containing  the  transaction.   Once  a  predetermined  number  of  coins  have  entered  \ncirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation  \nfree.\nThe incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.  If a greedy attacker is able to  \nassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it  \nto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.  He ought to  \nfind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than  \neveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\n7. Reclaiming Disk Space\nOnce the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before  \nit can be discarded to save disk space.  To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,  \ntransactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. \nOld blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.  The interior hashes do  \nnot need to be stored.\nA block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes.  If we suppose blocks are  \ngenerated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.  With computer systems  \ntypically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of  \n1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in  \nmemory.\n4\nBlockBlock\nBlock Header (Block Hash)\nPrev Hash Nonce\nHash01\nHash0 Hash1 Hash2 Hash3\nHash23\nRoot Hash\nHash01\nHash2\nTx3\nHash23\nBlock Header (Block Hash)\nRoot Hash\nTransactions Hashed in a Merkle Tree After Pruning Tx0-2 from the Block\nPrev Hash Nonce\nHash3\nTx0 Tx1 Tx2 Tx3",

A user only needs to keep  \na copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying  \nnetwork nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch  \nlinking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.  He can't  check the transaction for  \nhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,  \nand blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\nAs such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more  \nvulnerable  if  the  network  is overpowered  by an  attacker.  While  network  nodes can  verify  \ntransactions for themselves, the  simplified  method  can be  fooled by an attacker's fabricated  \ntransactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.  One strategy to  \nprotect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid  \nblock, prompting  the  user's  software  to  download  the  full  block  and alerted  transactions to  \nconfirm the inconsistency.  Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to  \nrun their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.\n9. Combining and Splitting Value\nAlthough it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a  \nseparate transaction for every cent in a transfer.  To allow value to be split and combined,  \ntransactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.  Normally there will be either a single input  \nfrom a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two \noutputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.  \nIt should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those  \ntransactions depend on many more, is not a problem here.  There is never the need to extract a  \ncomplete standalone copy of a transaction's history.\n5\nTransaction\nIn\n...\nIn Out\n...\nHash01\nHash2 Hash3\nHash23\nBlock Header\nMerkle Root\nPrev Hash Nonce\nBlock Header\nMerkle Root\nPrev Hash Nonce\nBlock Header\nMerkle Root\nPrev Hash Nonce\nMerkle Branch for Tx3\nLongest Proof-of-Work Chain\nTx3",

        "page_content": "10. Privacy\nThe traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the  \nparties involved and the trusted third party.  The necessity to announce all transactions publicly  \nprecludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in  \nanother place: by keeping public keys anonymous.  The public can see that someone is sending  \nan amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.  This is  \nsimilar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of  \nindividual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.\nAs an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them  \nfrom being linked to a common owner.  Some  linking is still unavoidable with multi-input  \ntransactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.  The risk  \nis that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to  \nthe same owner.\n11. Calculations\nWe consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest \nchain.  Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such  \nas creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.  Nodes are  \nnot going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block  \ncontaining them.  An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back  \nmoney he recently spent.\nThe race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial  \nRandom Walk.  The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its  \nlead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the  \ngap by -1.\nThe probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's  \nRuin problem.  Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an \ninfinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven.  We can calculate the probability he ever  \nreaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:\np = probability an honest node finds the next block\nq = probability the attacker finds the next block\nqz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind\nqz={\n1 if p≤q\nq/ pz\nif pq}\n6\nIdentities Transactions Trusted\nThird Party Counterparty Public\nIdentities Transactions Public\nNew Privacy Model\nTraditional Privacy Model",

Conclusion\nWe have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.  We started with  \nthe usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of  \nownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending.  To solve this, we  \nproposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions  \nthat quickly becomes computationally impractical  for  an attacker to change if honest nodes  \ncontrol a majority of CPU power.  The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.  Nodes  \nwork all at once with little coordination.  They do not need to be identified, since messages are  \nnot routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.  Nodes can  \nleave  and  rejoin  the  network  at  will,  accepting  the  proof-of-work  chain  as  proof  of  what  \nhappened while they were gone.  They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of  \nvalid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on  \nthem.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.\n8",

Y ou need only look at the his‐\ntory of computing inventions to see how network communications, relational data‐\nbases, big-data developments, and cloud computing have significantly altered how\narchitectures are built and how work is performed. Each of these inventions changed\nnot only the way that technology was used within various software projects, but also\nthe way that organizations, teams, and people communicated with one another. From\ncentralized mainframes to distributed mobile applications, each new medium has\nfundamentally changed people’s relationship with computing.\nThe medium of the asynchronously produced and consumed event has been funda‐\nmentally shifted by modern technology. These events can now be persisted indefi‐\nnitely, at extremely large scale, and be consumed by any service as many times as\nnecessary. Compute resources can be easily acquired and released on-demand, ena‐\nbling the easy creation and management of microservices. Microservices can store\nand manage their data according to their own needs, and do so at a scale that was\npreviously limited to batch-based big-data solutions. These improvements to the\nhumble and simple event-driven medium have far-reaching impacts that not only\nchange computer architectures, but also completely reshape how teams, people, and\norganizations create systems and businesses.\n1",

        "page_content": "What Are Event-Driven Microservices?\nMicroservices and microservice-style architectures have existed for many years, in\nmany different forms, under many different names. Service-oriented architectures\n(SOAs) are often composed of multiple microservices synchronously communicating\ndirectly with one another. Message-passing architectures use consumable events to\nasynchronously communicate with one another. Event-based communication is cer‐\ntainly not new, but the need for handling big data sets, at scale and in real time, is new\nand necessitates a change from the old architectural styles.\nIn a modern event-driven microservices architecture, systems communicate by issu‐\ning and consuming events. These events are not destroyed upon consumption as in\nmessage-passing systems, but instead remain readily available for other consumers to\nread as they require. This is an important distinction, as it allows for the truly power‐\nful patterns covered in this book.\nThe services themselves are small and purpose-built, created to help fulfill the neces‐\nsary business goals of the organization. A typical definition of “small” is something\nthat takes no more than two weeks to write. By another definition, the service should\nbe able to (conceptually) fit within one’s own head. These services consume events\nfrom input event streams; apply their specific business logic; and may emit their own\noutput events, provide data for request-response access, communicate with a third-\nparty API, or perform other required actions. As this book will detail, these services\ncan be stateful or stateless, complex or simple; and they might be implemented as\nlong-running, standalone applications or executed as a function using Functions-as-\na-Service.\nThis combination of event streams and microservices forms an interconnected graph\nof activity across a business organization. Traditional computer architectures, com‐\nposed of monoliths and intermonolith communications, have a similar graph struc‐\nture. Both of these graphs are shown in Figure 1-1.\n2 | Chapter 1: Why Event-Driven Microservices",

        "page_content": "Domain (and subdomain) model\nAn abstraction of the actual domain useful for business purposes. The pieces and\nproperties of the domain that are most important to the business are used to gen‐\nerate the model. The main domain model of an business is discernible through\nthe products the business provides its customers, the interfaces by which custom‐\ners interact with the products, and the various other processes and functions by\nwhich the business fulfills its stated goals. Models often need to be refined as the\ndomain changes and as business priorities shift. A domain model is part of the\nsolution space, as it is a construct the business uses to solve problems.\nBounded context\nThe logical boundaries, including the inputs, outputs, events, requirements, pro‐\ncesses, and data models, relevant to the subdomain. While ideally a bounded\ncontext and a subdomain will be in complete alignment, legacy systems, technical\ndebt, and third-party integrations often create exceptions. Bounded contexts are\nalso a property of the solution space and have a significant impact on how micro‐\nservices interact with one another.\nBounded contexts should be highly cohesive. The internal operations of the context\nshould be intensive and closely related, with the vast majority of communication\noccurring internally rather than cross-boundary. Having highly cohesive responsibili‐\nties allows for reduced design scope and simpler implementations.\nConnections between bounded contexts should be loosely coupled, as changes made\nwithin one bounded context should minimize or eliminate the impact on neighbor‐\ning contexts. A loose coupling can ensure that requirement changes in one context do\nnot propagate a surge of dependent changes to neighboring contexts.\nLeveraging Domain Models and Bounded Contexts\nEvery organization forms a single domain between itself and the outside world.\nEveryone working within the organization is operating to support the needs of its\ndomain.\nThis domain is broken down into subdomains—perhaps, for a technology-centric\ncompany, an Engineering department, a Sales department, and a Customer Support\ndepartment. Each subdomain has its own requirements and duties and may itself be\nsubdivided. This division process repeats until the subdomain models are granular\nand actionable and can be translated into small and independent services by the\nimplementing teams. Bounded contexts are established around these subdomains\nand form the basis for the creation of microservices.\n4 | Chapter 1: Why Event-Driven Microservices",

        "page_content": "Aligning Bounded Contexts with Business Requirements\nIt is common for the business requirements of a product to change during its lifetime,\nperhaps due to organizational changes or new feature requests. In contrast, it’s rare\nfor a company to need to change the underlying implementation of any given prod‐\nuct without accompanying business requirement changes. This is why bounded con‐\ntexts should be built around business requirements and not technological\nrequirements.\nAligning bounded contexts on business requirements allows teams to make changes\nto microservice implementations in a loosely coupled and highly cohesive way. It pro‐\nvides a team with the autonomy to design and implement a solution for the specific\nbusiness needs, which greatly reduces interteam dependencies and enables each team\nto focus strictly on its own requirements.\nConversely, aligning microservices on technical requirements is problematic. This\npattern is often seen in improperly designed synchronous point-to-point microservi‐\nces and in traditional monolith-style computing systems where teams own specific\ntechnical layers of the application. The main issue with technological alignment is\nthat it distributes the responsibility of fulfilling the business function across multiple\nbounded contexts, which may involve multiple teams with differing schedules and\nduties. Because no team is solely responsible for implementing a solution, each ser‐\nvice becomes coupled to another across both team and API boundaries, making\nchanges difficult and expensive. A seemingly innocent change, a bug, or a failed ser‐\nvice can have serious ripple effects to the business-serving capabilities of all services\nthat use the technical system. Technical alignment is seldomly used in event-driven\nmicroservice (EDM) architectures and should be avoided completely whenever possi‐\nble. Eliminating cross-cutting technological and team dependencies will reduce a sys‐\ntem’s sensitivity to change.\nFigure 1-2 shows both scenarios: sole ownership on the left and cross-cutting owner‐\nship on the right. With sole ownership, the team is fully organized around the two\nindependent business requirements (bounded contexts) and has complete control\nover its application code and the database layer. On the right, the teams have been\norganized via technical requirements, where the application layer is managed separate\nfrom the data layer. This creates explicit dependencies between the teams, as well as\nimplicit dependencies between the business requirements.\nIntroduction to Domain-Driven Design and Bounded Contexts | 5",

Alignment on business contexts versus on technological contexts\nModeling event-driven microservices architectures around business requirements is\npreferred, though there are tradeoffs with this approach. Code may be replicated a\nnumber of times, and many services may use similar data access patterns. Product\ndevelopers may try to reduce repetition by sharing data sources with other products\nor by coupling on boundaries. In these cases, the subsequent tight coupling may be\nfar more costly in the long run than repeating logic and storing similar data. These\ntradeoffs will be examined in greater detail throughout this book.\nKeep loose coupling between bounded contexts, and focus on min‐\nimizing intercontext dependencies. This will allow bounded con‐\ntext implementations to change as necessary, without subsequently\nbreaking many (or any) other systems.\nAdditionally, each team may be required to have full stack expertise, which can be\ncomplicated by the need for specialized skill sets and access permissions. The organi‐\nzation should operationalize the most common requirements such that these vertical\nteams can support themselves, while more specialized skill sets can be provided on a\ncross-team, as-needed basis. These best practices are covered in more detail in\nChapter 14.\nCommunication Structures\nAn organization’s teams, systems, and people all must communicate with one another\nto fulfill their goals.

The organi‐\nzation of teams and the provisioning of their goals, from the major business units\ndown to the work of the individual contributor, fall under this structure. Business\nrequirements, their assignment to teams, and team compositions all change over\ntime, which can greatly impact the relationship between the business communication\nstructure and the implementation communication structure.\nFigure 1-3.

It formalizes busi‐\nness processes, data structures, and system design so that business operations can be\nperformed quickly and efficiently. This results in a tradeoff in flexibility for the busi‐\nness communication structure, as redefining the business requirements that must be\nsatisfied by the implementation requires a rewrite of the logic.

(April 1968)\nThis quote, known as Conway’s law, implies that a team will build products according\nto the communication structures of its organization. Business communication struc‐\ntures organize people into teams, and these teams typically produce products that are\ndelimited by their team boundaries. Implementation communication structures pro‐\nvide access to the subdomain data models for a given product, but also restrict access\nto other products due to the weak data communication capabilities.\nBecause domain concepts span the business, domain data is often needed by other\nbounded contexts within an organization. Implementation communication structures\nare generally poor at providing this communication mechanism, though they excel at\nsupplying the needs of their own bounded context. They influence the design of\nproducts in two ways. First, due to the inefficiencies of communicating the necessary\ndomain data across the organization, they discourage the creation of new, logically\nseparate products. Second, they provide easy access to existing domain data, at the\nrisk of continually expanding the domain to encompass the new business require‐\nments. This particular pattern is embodied by monolithic designs.\nData communication structures play a pivotal role in how an organization designs\nand builds products, but for many organizations this structure has long been missing.\nAs noted, implementation communication structures frequently play this role in\naddition to their own.\nCommunication Structures | 9",

Let’s take a look at their options\nin a bit more detail.\nOption 1: Make a New Service\nThe business requirement is different enough that it could make sense to put it into a\nnew service. But what about data? This new business function needs some of the old\ndata, but that data is currently locked up in the existing service.

They\nneed to ensure that they don’t expose the inner workings and that the changes they\nmake to their data structures won’t affect any other teams copying their data. Addi‐\ntionally, the data being copied will always be somewhat stale, as they can only afford\nto copy production data in real time every 30 minutes so as not to saturate the data\nstore with queries. This connection will need to be monitored and maintained to\nensure that it is running correctly.\nThere is also a risk in spinning up and running a new service. They will need to man‐\nage two data stores, and two services, and establish logging, monitoring, testing,\ndeployment, and rollback processes for them. They must also take care to synchron‐\nize any data structure changes so as not to affect the dependent system.\nOption 2: Add It to the Existing Service\nThe other option is to create the new data structures and business logic within the\nexisting service. The required data is already in the data store, and the logging, moni‐\ntoring, testing, deployment, and rollback processes are already defined and in use.\nThe team is familiar with the system and can get right to work on implementing the\nlogic, and their monolithic patterns support this approach to service design.\nThere are also risks associated with this approach, though they are a bit more subtle.\nBoundaries within the implementation can blur as changes are made, especially since\nmodules are often bundled together in the same codebase. It is far too easy to quickly\nadd features by crossing those boundaries and directly couple across the module. \nThere is a major boon to moving quickly, but it comes at the cost of tight couplings,\nreduced cohesion, and a lack of modularity. Though teams can guard against this, it\nrequires excellent planning and strict adherence to boundaries, which often fall by\nthe wayside in the face of tight schedules, inexperience, and shifting service\nownership.\nPros and Cons of Each Option\nMost teams would choose the second option—adding the functionality to the existing\nsystem. There is nothing wrong with this choice; monolithic architectures are useful\nand powerful structures and can provide exceptional value to a business. The first\noption runs head first into the two problems associated with traditional computing:\n• Accessing another system’s data is difficult to do reliably, especially at scale and in\nreal time.\nCommunication Structures in Traditional Computing | 11",

Any\ndata encapsulated in another team’s data store is difficult to obtain, as it requires\ncrossing both implementation and business communication boundaries. This\nbecomes increasingly difficult to maintain and scale as data, connection count, and\nperformance requirements grow.\nThough copying the necessary data over is a worthy approach, it’s not foolproof. This\nmodel encourages many direct point-to-point couplings, which become problematic\nto maintain as an organization grows, business units and ownership change, and\nproducts mature and phase out. It creates a strict technical dependency the imple‐\nmentation communication structures of both teams (the team storing the data and\nthe team copying it), requiring them to work in synchronicity whenever a data\nchange is made. Special care must be taken to ensure that the internal data model of\nan implementation is not unduly exposed, lest other systems tightly couple to it. Scal‐\nability, performance, and system availability are often issues for both systems, as the\ndata replication query may place an unsustainable load on the source system. Failed\nsync processes may not be noticed until an emergency occurs. Tribal knowledge may\nresult in a team copying a copy of data, thinking that it’s the original source of truth.\nCopied data will always be somewhat stale by the time the query is complete and the\ndata is transferred. The larger the data set and the more complex its sourcing, the\nmore likely a copy will be out of sync with the original. This is problematic when sys‐\ntems expect each other to have perfect, up-to-date copies, particularly when commu‐\nnicating with one another about that data. For instance, a reporting service may\nreport different values than a billing service due to staleness. This can have serious\ndownstream consequences for service quality, reporting, analytics, and monetary-\nbased decision making.\nThe inability to correctly disseminate data throughout a company is not due to a fun‐\ndamental flaw in the concept. Quite the contrary: it’s due to a weak or nonexistent\ndata communication structure. In the preceding scenario, the team’s implementation\ncommunication structure is performing double duty as an extremely limited data\ncommunication structure.\nOne of the tenets of event-driven microservices is that core busi‐\nness data should be easy to obtain and usable by any service that\nrequires it. This replaces the ad hoc data communication structure\nin this scenario with a formalized data communication structure.\nFor the hypothetical team, this data communication structure\ncould eliminate most of the difficulties of obtaining data from\nother systems.\n12 | Chapter 1: Why Event-Driven Microservices",

It was quick, it was easy, and they have implemented\na number of new features since then. As the company has grown, the team has grown,\nand now it is time for it to be reorganized into two smaller, more focused teams.\nEach new team must now be assigned certain business functions from the previous\nservice. The business requirements of each team are neatly divided based on areas of\nthe business that need the most attention. Dividing the implementation communica‐\ntion structure, however, is not proving to be easy. Just as before, it seems that the\nteams both require large amounts of the same data to fulfill their requirements. New\nsets of questions arise:\n• Which team should own which data?\n• Where should the data reside?\n• What about data where both teams need to modify the values?\nThe team leads decide that it may be best to just share the service instead, and both of\nthem can work on different parts. This will require a lot more cross-team communi‐\ncation and synchronization of efforts, which may be a drag on productivity. And what\nabout in the future, if they double in size again? Or if the business requirements\nchange enough that they’re no longer able to fulfill everything with the same data\nstructure?\nConflicting Pressures\nThere are two conflicting pressures on the original team. It was influenced to keep all\nof its data local in one service to make adding new business functions quicker and\neasier, at the cost of expanding the implementation communication structure. Even‐\ntually the growth of the team necessitated splitting up the business communication\nstructure—a requirement followed by the reassignment of business requirements to\nthe new teams. The implementation communication structure, however, cannot sup‐\nport the reassignments in its current form and needs to be broken down into suitable\ncomponents. Neither approach is scalable, and both point to a need to do things dif‐\nferently. These problems all stem from the same root cause: a weak, ill-defined means\nof communicating data between implementation communication structures.\nEvent-Driven Communication Structures\nThe event-driven approach offers an alternative to the traditional behavior of imple‐\nmentation and data communication structures. Event-based communications are not\na drop-in replacement for request-response communications, but rather a completely\nEvent-Driven Communication Structures | 13",

Services no longer couple directly through a request-response API, but instead\nthrough event data defined within event streams (this process is covered more in\nChapter 3). Producers’ responsibilities are limited to producing well-defined data into\ntheir respective event streams.\nEvents Are the Basis of Communication\nAll shareable data is published to a set of event streams, forming a continuous, can‐\nonical narrative detailing everything that has happened in the organization. This\nbecomes the channel by which systems communicate with one another. Nearly any‐\nthing can be communicated as an event, from simple occurrences to complex, stateful\nrecords. Events are the data; they are not merely signals indicating data is ready else‐\nwhere or just a means of direct data transfer from one implementation to another.\nRather, they act both as data storage and as a means of asynchronous communication\nbetween services.\nEvent Streams Provide the Single Source of Truth\nEach event in a stream is a statement of fact, and together these statements form the\nsingle source of truth—the basis of communication for all systems within the organi‐\nzation. A communication structure is only as good as the veracity of its information,\nso it’s critical that the organization adopts the event stream narrative as a single\nsource of truth. If some teams choose instead to put conflicting data in other loca‐\ntions, the event stream’s function as the organization’s data communications back‐\nbone is significantly diminished.\nConsumers Perform Their Own Modeling and Querying\nThe event-based data communication structure differs from an overextended imple‐\nmentation communication structure in that it is incapable of providing any querying\nor data lookup functionality. All business and application logic must be encapsulated\nwithin the producer and consumer of the events.\nData access and modeling requirements are completely shifted to the consumer, with\nconsumers each obtaining their own copy of events from the source event streams.\nAny querying complexity is also shifted from the implementation communication\nstructure of the data owner to that of the consumer. The consumer remains fully\nresponsible for any mixing of data from multiple event streams, special query func‐\ntionality, or other business-specific implementation logic. Both producers and con‐\nsumers are otherwise relieved of their duty to provide querying mechanisms, data\ntransfer mechanisms, APIs (application programming interfaces), and cross-team\n14 | Chapter 1: Why Event-Driven Microservices",

They are now limited in their respon‐\nsibility to only solving the needs of their immediate bounded context.\nData Communication Is Improved Across the Organization\nThe usage of a data communications structure is an inversion, with all shareable data\nbeing exposed outside of the implementation communication structure. Not all data\nmust be shared, and thus not all of it needs to be published to the set of event streams.\nHowever, any data that is of interest to any other team or service must be published to\nthe common set of event streams, such that the production and ownership of data\nbecomes fully decoupled. This provides the formalized data communication structure\nthat has long been missing from system architectures and better adheres to the boun‐\nded context principles of loose coupling and high cohesiveness.\nApplications can now access data that would otherwise have been laborious to obtain\nvia point-to-point connections. New services can simply acquire any needed data\nfrom the canonical event streams, create their own models and state, and perform any\nnecessary business functions without depending on direct point-to-point connec‐\ntions or APIs with any other service. This unlocks the potential for an organization to\nmore effectively use its vast amounts of data in any product, and even mix data from\nmultiple products in unique and powerful ways.\nAccessible Data Supports Business Communication Changes\nEvent streams contain core domain events that are central to the operation of the\nbusiness. Though teams may restructure and projects may come and go, the impor‐\ntant core domain data remains readily available to any new product that requires it,\nindependent of any specific implementation communication structure . This gives the\nbusiness unparalleled flexibility, as access to core domain events no longer relies upon\nany particular implementation.\nAsynchronous Event-Driven Microservices\nEvent-driven microservices enable the business logic transformations and operations\nnecessary to meet the requirements of the bounded context. These applications are\ntasked with fulfilling these requirements and emitting any of their own necessary\nevents to other downstream consumers. Here are a few of the primary benefits of\nusing event-driven microservices:\nGranularity\nServices map neatly to bounded contexts and can be easily rewritten when busi‐\nness requirements change.\nScalability\nIndividual services can be scaled up and down as needed.\nAsynchronous Event-Driven Microservices | 15",

This also allows\nfor easy prototyping using pioneering technology.\nBusiness requirement flexibility\nOwnership of granular microservices is easy to reorganize. There are fewer cross-\nteam dependencies compared to large services, and the organization can react\nmore quickly to changes in business requirements that would otherwise be impe‐\nded by barriers to data access.\nLoosely coupling\nEvent-driven microservices are coupled on domain data and not on a specific\nimplementation API. Data schemas can be used to greatly improve how data\nchanges are managed, as will be discussed in Chapter 3.\nContinuous delivery support\nIt’s easy to ship a small, modular microservice, and roll it back if needed.\nHigh testability\nMicroservices tend to have fewer dependencies than large monoliths, making it\neasier to mock out the required testing endpoints and ensure proper code\ncoverage.\nExample Team Using Event-Driven Microservices\nLet’s revisit the team from earlier but with an event-driven data communication\nstructure.\nA new business requirement is introduced to the team. It’s somewhat related to what\ntheir current products do, but it’s also different enough that it could go into its own\nservice. Does adding it to an existing service violate the single responsibility principle\nand overextend the currently defined bounded context? Or is it a simple extension,\nperhaps the addition of some new related data or functionality, of an existing service?\nPrevious technical issues—such as figuring out where to source the data and how to\nsink it, handling batch syncing issues, and implementing synchronous APIs—are\nlargely removed now. The team can spin up a new microservice and ingest the neces‐\nsary data from the event streams, all the way back to the beginning of time if needed.\nIt is entirely possible that the team mixes in common data used in their other services,\nso long as that data is used solely to fulfill the needs of the new bounded context. The\nstorage and structure of this data are left entirely up to the team, which can choose\nwhich fields to keep and which to discard.\nBusiness risks are also alleviated, as the small, finer-grained services allow for single\nteam ownership, enabling the teams to scale and reorganize as necessary. When the\nteam grows too large to manage under a single business owner, they can split up as\n16 | Chapter 1: Why Event-Driven Microservices",

The ownership of the event data\nmoves with the producing service, and organizational decisions can be made to\nreduce the amount of cross-team communication required to perform future work.\nThe nature of the microservice prevents spaghetti code and expansive monoliths\nfrom taking hold, provided that the overhead for creating new services and obtaining\nthe necessary data is minimal. Scaling concerns are now focused on individual event-\nprocessing services, which can scale their CPU, memory, disk, and instance count as\nrequired. The remaining scaling requirements are offloaded onto the data communi‐\ncation structure, which must ensure that it can handle the various loads of services\nconsuming from and producing to its event streams.\nTo do all of this, however, the team needs to ensure that the data is indeed present in\nthe data communication structure, and they must have the means for easily spinning\nup and managing a fleet of microservices. This requires an organization-wide adop‐\ntion of EDM architecture.\nSynchronous Microservices\nMicroservices can be implemented asynchronously using events (the approach this\nbook advocates) or synchronously, which is common in service-oriented architec‐\ntures. Synchronous microservices tend to be fulfilled using a request-response\napproach, where services communicate directly through APIs to fulfill business\nrequirements.\nDrawbacks of Synchronous Microservices\nThere are a number of issues with synchronous microservices that make them diffi‐\ncult to use at large scale. This is not to say that a company cannot succeed by using\nsynchronous microservices, as evidenced by the achievements of companies such as\nNetflix, Lyft, Uber, and Facebook. But many companies have also made fortunes\nusing archaic and horribly tangled spaghetti-code monoliths, so do not confuse the\nultimate success of a company with the quality of its underlying architecture. There\nare a number of books that describe how to implement synchronous microservices,\nso I recommend that you read those to get a better understanding of synchronous\napproaches.1\nFurthermore, note that neither point-to-point request-response microservices nor\nasynchronous event-driven microservices are strictly better than the other. Both have\ntheir place in an organization, as some tasks are far better suited to one over the\nSynchronous Microservices | 17",

Perhaps you’ll come to agree as you\nproceed through this book, but at the very least, you’ll gain an understanding of their\nstrengths and drawbacks.\nHere are some of the biggest shortcomings of synchronous request-response micro‐\nservices.\nPoint-to-point couplings\nSynchronous microservices rely on other services to help them perform their busi‐\nness tasks. Those services, in turn, have their own dependent services, which have\ntheir own dependent services, and so on. This can lead to excessive fanout and diffi‐\ncultly in tracing which services are responsible for fulfilling specific parts of the busi‐\nness logic. The number of connections between services can become staggeringly\nhigh, which further entrenches the existing communication structures and makes\nfuture changes more difficult.\nDependent scaling\nThe ability to scale up your own service depends on the ability of all dependent serv‐\nices to scale up as well and is directly related to the degree of communications fanout.\nImplementation technologies can be a bottleneck on scalability. This is further com‐\nplicated by highly variable loads and surging request patterns, which all need to be\nhandled synchronously across the entire architecture.\nService failure handling\nIf a dependent service is down, then decisions must be made about how to handle the\nexception. Deciding how to handle the outages, when to retry, when to fail, and how\nto recover to ensure data consistency becomes increasingly difficult the more services\nthere are within the ecosystem.\nAPI versioning and dependency management\nMultiple API definitions and service versions will often need to exist at the same\ntime. It is not always possible or desirable to force clients to upgrade to the newest\nAPI. This can add a lot of complexity in orchestrating API change requests across\nmultiple services, especially if they are accompanied by changes to the underlying\ndata structures.\nData access tied to the implementation\nSynchronous microservices have all the same problems as traditional services when it\ncomes to accessing external data.

This puts the onus of data access and\nscalability back on the implementation communication structure.\nDistributed monoliths\nServices may be composed such that they act as a distributed monolith, with many\nintertwining calls being made between them. This situation often arises when a team\nis decomposing a monolith and decides to use synchronous point-to-point calls to\nmimic the existing boundaries within their monolith. Point-to-point services make it\neasy to blur the lines between the bounded contexts, as the function calls to remote\nsystems can slot in line-for-line with existing monolith code.\nTesting\nIntegration testing can be difficult, as each service requires fully operational depend‐\nents, which require their own in turn. Stubbing them out may work for unit tests, but\nseldom proves sufficient for more extensive testing requirements.\nBenefits of Synchronous Microservices\nThere are a number of undeniable benefits provided by synchronous microservices.\nCertain data access patterns are favorable to direct request-response couplings, such\nas authenticating a user and reporting on an AB test. Integrations with external third-\nparty solutions almost always use a synchronous mechanism and generally provide a\nflexible, language-agnostic communication mechanism over HTTP .\nTracing operations across multiple systems can be easier in a synchronous environ‐\nment than in an asynchronous one. Detailed logs can show which functions were\ncalled on which systems, allowing for high debuggability and visibility into business\noperations.\nServices hosting web and mobile experiences are by and large powered by request-\nresponse designs, regardless of their synchronous or asynchronous nature. Clients\nreceive a timely response dedicated entirely to their needs.\nThe experience factor is also quite important, especially as many developers in today’s\nmarket tend to be much more experienced with synchronous, monolithic-style cod‐\ning. This makes acquiring talent for synchronous systems easier, in general, than\nacquiring talent for asynchronous event-driven development.\nA company’s architecture could only rarely, if ever, be based\nentirely on event-driven microservices. Hybrid architectures will\ncertainly be the norm, where synchronous and asynchronous solu‐\ntions are deployed side-by-side as the problem space requires.\nSynchronous Microservices | 19",

Consumer microservices consume and process events from one or more\ninput event streams, whereas producer microservices produce events to event streams\nfor other services to consume. It is common for an event-driven microservice to be a\nconsumer of one set of input event streams and a producer of another set of output\nevent streams. These services may be stateless (see Chapter 5) or stateful (see Chap‐\nter 7 ) and may also contain synchronous request-response APIs (see Chapter 13 ).\nThese services all share the common functionality of consuming events from or pro‐\nducing events to the event broker. Communication between event-driven microservi‐\nces is completely asynchronous.\nEvent streams are served by an event broker, which is covered in more detail in the\nsecond half of this chapter. Running microservices at any meaningful scale often\nnecessitates using deployment pipelines and container management systems, also dis‐\ncussed near the end of this chapter.\nBuilding Topologies\nThe term topology comes up frequently in discussions of event-driven microservices.\nThis term is often used to mean the processing logic of an individual microservice. It\nmay also be used to refer to the graph-like relationship between individual microser‐\nvices, event streams, and request-response APIs. Let’s look at each definition in turn.\nMicroservice Topology\nA microservice topology is the event-driven topology internal to a single microser‐\nvice. This defines the data-driven operations to be performed on incoming events,\nincluding transformation, storage, and emission.\n21",

As such, they must\ncontain all the information required to accurately describe what happened.\nThe Structure of an Event\nEvents are typically represented using a key/value format.

They provide a\ncontinual history of the state of an entity and can be used to materialize state (covered\nin the next section). Only the latest entity event is needed to determine the current\nstate of an entity.\nKeyed Event\nA keyed event contains a key but does not represent an entity. Keyed events are usually\nused for partitioning the stream of events to guarantee data locality within a single\npartition of an event stream (more on this later in the chapter).

Each entity event is upserted into the key/value table, such that the\nmost recently read event for a given key is represented. Conversely, you can convert a\ntable into a stream of entity events by publishing each update to the event stream. \nThis is known as the table-stream duality, and it is fundamental to the creation of\nstate in an event-driven microservice. This is illustrated in Figure 2-3, where AA and\nCC both have the newest values in their materialized table.\nUpserting means inserting a new row if it doesn’t already exist in\nthe table, or updating it if it does.\nFigure 2-3.

Generating an event stream from the changes applied to a table\nA relational database table, for instance, is created and populated through a series of\ndata insertion, update, and deletion commands. These commands can be produced as\nevents to an immutable log, such as a local append-only file (like the binary log in\nMySQL) or an external event stream. By playing back the entire contents of the log,\nyou can exactly reconstruct the table and all of its data contents.\nThis table-stream duality is used for communicating state between\nevent-driven microservices. Any consumer client can read an event\nstream of keyed events and materialize it into its own local state\nstore. This simple yet powerful pattern allows microservices to\nshare state through events alone, without any direct coupling\nbetween producer and consumer services.\nThe deletion of a keyed event is handled by producing a tombstone. A tombstone is a\nkeyed event with its value set to null. This is a convention that indicates to the con‐\nsumer that the event with that key should be removed from the materialized data\nstore, as the upstream producer has declared that it is now deleted.\nAppend-only immutable logs may grow indefinitely unless they are compacted. Com‐\npaction is performed by the event broker to reduce the size of its internal logs by\nretaining only the most recent event for a given key. Older events of the same key will\nbe deleted, and the remaining events compacted down into a new and smaller set of\nfiles. The event stream offsets are maintained such that no changes are required by\nthe consumers. Figure 2-5 illustrates the logical compaction of an event stream in the\nevent broker, including the total deletion of the tombstone record.\n26 | Chapter 2: Event-Driven Microservice Fundamentals",

It is a near-certainty that your entire business\nmodel will not be able to fit in a purely stateless streaming domain, as past business\ndecisions will influence decisions you make today. As a specific example, if your busi‐\nness is retail, you will need to know your stock level to identify when you need to\nreorder and to avoid selling customers items you do not have.

Perhaps you\nwant to have a weekly promotion sent to all the customers who have provided you\ntheir email addresses. All of these systems require that you have the ability to materi‐\nalize streams of events into current state representations.\nEvent Data Definitions and Schemas\nEvent data serves as the means of long term and implementation agnostic data stor‐\nage, as well as the communication mechanism between services. Therefore, it is\nimportant that both the producers and consumers of events have a common under‐\nstanding of the meaning of the data. Ideally, the consumer must be able to interpret\nthe contents and meaning of an event without having to consult with the owner of the\nproducing service. This requires a common language for communication between\nproducers and consumers and is analogous to an API definition between synchro‐\nnous request-response services.\nSchematization selections such as Apache Avro and Google’s Protobuf provide two\nfeatures that are leveraged heavily in event-driven microservices. First, they provide\nan evolution framework, where certain sets of changes can be safely made to the sche‐\nmas without requiring downstream consumers to make a code change.

This microservice\nis the owner of each event produced to that stream. This allows for the authoritative\nsource of truth to always be known for any given event, by permitting the tracing of\ndata lineage through the system. Access control mechanisms, as discussed in Chap‐\nter 14, should be used to enforce ownership and write boundaries.\nPowering Microservices with the Event Broker\nAt the heart of every production-ready event-driven microservice platform is the\nevent broker. This is a system that receives events, stores them in a queue or parti‐\ntioned event stream, and provides them for consumption by other processes. Events\nare typically published to different streams based on their underlying logical mean‐\ning, similar to how a database will have many tables, each logically separated to con‐\ntain a specific type of data.\nEvent broker systems suitable for large-scale enterprises all generally follow the same\nmodel. Multiple, distributed event brokers work together in a cluster to provide a\nplatform for the production and consumption of event streams. This model provides\nseveral essential features that are required for running an event-driven ecosystem at\nscale:\nScalability\nAdditional event broker instances can be added to increase the cluster’s produc‐\ntion, consumption, and data storage capacity.\nDurability\nEvent data is replicated between nodes. This permits a cluster of brokers to both\npreserve and continue serving data when a broker fails.\nHigh availability\nA cluster of event broker nodes enables clients to connect to other nodes in the\ncase of a broker failure. This permits the clients to maintain full uptime.\nHigh-performance\nMultiple broker nodes share the production and consumption load. In addition,\neach broker node must be highly performant to be able to handle hundreds of\nthousands of writes or reads per second.\n28 | Chapter 2: Event-Driven Microservice Fundamentals",

        "page_content": "Though there are different ways in which event data can be stored, replicated, and\naccessed behind the scenes of an event broker, they all generally provide the same\nmechanisms of storage and access to their clients.\nEvent Storage and Serving\nThese are the minimal requirements of the underlying storage of the data by the\nbroker:\nPartitioning\nEvent streams can be partitioned into individual substreams, the number of\nwhich can vary depending on the needs of the producer and consumer. This par‐\ntitioning mechanism allows for multiple instances of a consumer to process each\nsubstream in parallel, allowing for far greater throughput. Note that queues do\nnot require partitioning, though it may be useful to partition them anyway for\nperformance purposes.\nStrict ordering\nData in an event stream partition is strictly ordered, and it is served to clients in\nthe exact same order that it was originally published.\nImmutability\nAll event data is completely immutable once published. There is no mechanism\nthat can modify event data once it is published. Y ou can alter previous data only\nby publishing a new event with the updated data.\nIndexing\nEvents are assigned an index when written to the event stream. This is used by\nthe consumers to manage data consumption, as they can specify which offset to\nbegin reading from. The difference between the consumer’s current index and\nthe tail index is the consumer lag. This metric can be used to scale up the number\nof consumers when it is high, and scale them down when it is low. Additionally, it\ncan also be used to awaken Functions-as-a-Service logic.\nInfinite retention\nEvent streams must be able to retain events for an infinite period of time. This\nproperty is foundational for maintaining state in an event stream.\nReplayability\nEvent streams must be replayable, such that any consumer can read whatever\ndata it requires. This provides the basis for the single source of truth and is foun‐\ndational for communicating state between microservices.\nPowering Microservices with the Event Broker | 29",

Event brokers can be used in place of a message\nbroker, but a message broker cannot fulfill all the functions of an event broker. Let’s\ncompare them in more depth.\nMessage brokers have a long history and have been used in large-scale message-\noriented middleware architectures by numerous organizations. Message brokers\nenable systems to communicate across a network through publish/subscribe message\nqueues. Producers write messages to a queue, while a consumer consumes these mes‐\nsages and processes them accordingly. Messages are then acknowledged as consumed\nand deleted either immediately or shortly thereafter. Message brokers are designed to\nhandle a different type of problem than event brokers.\nEvent brokers, on the other hand, are designed around providing an ordered log of\nfacts. Event brokers meet two very specific needs that are not satisfied by the message\nbroker. For one, the message broker provides only queues of messages, where the\nEvent Brokers Versus Message Brokers | 31",

        "page_content": "consumption of the message is handled on a per-queue basis. Applications that share\nconsumption from a queue will each receive only a subset of the records. This makes\nit impossible to correctly communicate state via events, since each consumer is\nunable to obtain a full copy of all events. Unlike the message broker, the event broker\nmaintains a single ledger of records and manages individual access via indices, so\neach independent consumer can access all required events. Additionally, a message\nbroker deletes events after acknowledgment, whereas an event broker retains them\nfor as long as the organization needs. The deletion of the event after consumption\nmakes a message broker insufficient for providing the indefinitely stored, globally\naccessible, replayable, single source of truth for all applications.\nEvent brokers enable an immutable, append-only log of facts that\npreserves the state of event ordering. The consumer can pick up\nand reprocess from anywhere in the log at any time. This pattern is\nessential for enabling event-driven microservices, but it is not\navailable with message brokers.\nKeep in mind that queues, as used in message brokers, still have a role in event-driven\nmicroservices. Queues provide useful access patterns that may be awkward to imple‐\nment with strictly partitioned event streams. The patterns introduced by message\nbroker systems are certainly valid patterns for EDM architectures, but they are not\nsufficient for the full scope of duties such architectures require. The remainder of the\nbook focuses not on any message broker architectures or application design, but\ninstead on the usage of event brokers in EDM architectures.\nConsuming from the Immutable Log\nThough not a definitive standard, commonly available event brokers use an append-\nonly immutable log. Events are appended at the end of the log and given an autoincre‐\nmenting index ID. Consumers of the data use a reference to the index ID to access\ndata. Events can then be consumed as either an event stream or a queue, depending\non the needs of the business and the available functionality of the event broker.\nConsuming as an event stream\nEach consumer is responsible for updating its own pointers to previously read indices\nwithin the event stream. This index, known as the offset, is the measurement of the\ncurrent event from the beginning of the event stream. Offsets permit multiple con‐\nsumers to consume and track their progress independently of one another, as shown\nin Figure 2-6.\n32 | Chapter 2: Event-Driven Microservice Fundamentals",

Consumer groups and their per-partition offsets\nThe consumer group allows for multiple consumers to be viewed as the same logical\nentity and can be leveraged for horizontal scaling of message consumption. A new\nconsumer joins the consumer group, causing a redistribution of event stream parti‐\ntion assignments. The new consumer consumes events only from its assigned parti‐\ntions, just as older consumer instances previously in the group continue to consume\nonly from their remaining assigned partitions. In this way, event consumption can be\nbalanced across the same consumer group, while ensuring that all events for a given\npartition are exclusively consumed by a single consumer instance. The number of\nactive consumer instances in the group is limited to the number of partitions in the\nevent stream.\nConsuming as a queue\nIn queue-based consumption, each event is consumed by one and only one microser‐\nvice instance. Upon being consumed, that event is marked as “consumed” by the\nevent broker and is no longer provided to any other consumer. Partition counts do\nnot matter when consuming as a queue, as any number of consumer instances can be\nused for consumption.\nEvent order is not maintained when processing from a queue. Par‐\nallel consumers consume and process events out of order, while a\nsingle consumer may fail to process an event, return it to the queue\nfor processing at a later date, and move on to the next event.\nQueues are not supported by all event brokers. For instance, Apache Pulsar currently\nsupports queues while Apache Kafka does not. Figure 2-7 shows the implementation\nof a queue using individual offset acknowledgment.\nEvent Brokers Versus Message Brokers | 33",

Consuming from an immutable log as a queue\nProviding a Single Source of Truth\nThe durable and immutable log provides the storage mechanism for the single source\nof truth, with the event broker becoming the only location in which services consume\nand produce data. This way, every consumer is guaranteed to be given an identical\ncopy of the data.\nAdopting the event broker as the single source of truth requires a culture shift in the\norganization. Whereas previously a team may simply have written direct SQL queries\nto access data in a monolith’s database, now the team must also publish the monolith’s\ndata to the event broker. The developers managing the monolith must ensure that the\ndata produced is fully accurate, because any disagreement between the event streams\nand the monolith’s database will be considered a failure of the producing team. Con‐\nsumers of the data no longer couple directly on the monolith, but instead consume\ndirectly from the event streams.\nThe adoption of event-driven microservices enables the creation of services that use\nonly the event broker to store and access data. While local copies of the events may\ncertainly be used by the business logic of the microservice, the event broker remains\nthe single source of truth for all data.\nManaging Microservices at Scale\nManaging microservices can become increasingly difficult as the number of services\ngrows. Each microservice requires specific compute resources, data stores, configura‐\ntions, environment variables, and a whole host of other microservice-specific proper‐\nties. Each microservice must also be manageable and deployable by the team that\nowns it. Containerization and virtualization, along with their associated management\nsystems, are common ways to achieve this. Both options allow individual teams to\ncustomize the requirements of their microservices through a single unit of\ndeployability.\n34 | Chapter 2: Event-Driven Microservice Fundamentals",

        "page_content": "Putting Microservices into Containers\nContainers, as recently popularized by Docker, isolate applications from one another.\nContainers leverage the existing host operating system via a shared kernel model.\nThis provides basic separation between containers, while the container itself isolates\nenvironment variables, libraries, and other dependencies. Containers provide most of\nthe benefits of a virtual machine (covered next) at a fraction of the cost, with fast\nstartup times and low resource overhead.\nContainers’ shared operating system approach does have some tradeoffs. Container‐\nized applications must be able to run on the host OS. If an application requires a spe‐\ncialized OS, then an independent host will need to be set up. Security is one of the\nmajor concerns, since containers share access to the host machine’s OS. A vulnerabil‐\nity in the kernel can put all the containers on that host at risk. With friendly work‐\nloads this is unlikely to be a problem, but current shared tenancy models in cloud\ncomputing are beginning to make it a bigger consideration.\nPutting Microservices into Virtual Machines\nVirtual machines (VMs) address some of the shortcomings of containers, though\ntheir adoption has been slower. Traditional VMs provide full isolation with a self-\ncontained OS and virtualized hardware specified for each instance. Although this\nalternative provides higher security than containers, it has historically been much\nmore expensive. Each VM has higher overhead costs compared to containers, with\nslower startup times and larger system footprints.\nEfforts are under way to make VMs cheaper and more efficient.\nCurrent initiatives include Google’s gVisor, Amazon’s Firecracker,\nand Kata Containers, to mention just a few. As these technologies\nimprove, VMs will become a much more competitive alternative to\ncontainers for your microservice needs. It is worth keeping an eye\non this domain should your needs be driven by security-first\nrequirements.\nManaging Containers and Virtual Machines\nContainers and VMs are managed through a variety of purpose-built software known\nas container management systems  (CMSes). These control container deployment,\nresource allocation, and integration with the underlying compute resources. Popular\nand commonly used CMSes include Kubernetes, Docker Engine , Mesos Marathon,\nAmazon ECS, and Nomad.\nMicroservices must be able to scale up and down depending on changing workloads,\nservice-level agreements (SLAs), and performance requirements. Vertical scaling\nmust be supported, in which compute resources such as CPU, memory, and disk are\nManaging Microservices at Scale | 35",

        "page_content": "increased or decreased on each microservice instance. Horizontal scaling must also\nbe supported, with new instances added or removed.\nEach microservice should be deployed as a single unit. For many microservices, a sin‐\ngle executable is all that is needed to perform its business requirements, and it can be\ndeployed within a single container. Other microservices may be more complex, with\nmultiple containers and external data stores requiring coordination. This is where\nsomething like Kubernetes’s pod concept comes into play, allowing for multiple con‐\ntainers to be deployed and reverted as a single action. Kubernetes also allows for\nsingle-run operations; for example, database migrations can be run during the execu‐\ntion of the single deployable.\nVM management is supported by a number of implementations, but is currently\nmore limited than container management. Kubernetes and Docker Engine support\nGoogle’s gVisor and Kata Containers, while Amazon’s platform supports AWS Fire‐\ncracker. The lines between containers and VMs will continue to blur as development\ncontinues. Make sure that the CMS you select will handle the containers and VMs\nthat you require of it.\nThere are rich sets of resources available for Kubernetes, Docker,\nMesos, Amazon ECS , and Nomad. The information they provide\ngoes far beyond what I can present here. I encourage you to look\ninto these materials for more information.\nPaying the Microservice Tax\nThe microservice tax is the sum of costs, including financial, manpower, and opportu‐\nnity, associated with implementing the tools and components of a microservice archi‐\ntecture. This includes the cost of managing, deploying, and operating the event\nbroker, CMS, deployment pipelines, monitoring solutions, and logging services.\nThese expenses are unavoidable and are paid either centrally by the organization or\nindependently by each team implementing microservices. The former results in a\nscalable, simplified, and unified framework for developing microservices, while the\nlatter results in excessive overhead, duplicate solutions, fragmented tooling, and\nunsustainable growth.\nPaying the microservice tax is not a trivial matter, and it is one of the largest impedi‐\nments to getting started with EDM. Small organizations would likely do best to stick\nwith an architecture that better suits their business needs, such as a modular mono‐\nlith. Larger organizations need to account for the total costs of both the\nimplementation and maintenance of a microservice platform and determine if the\nlong-term roadmap of their business can accommodate the predicted work efforts.\n36 | Chapter 2: Event-Driven Microservice Fundamentals",

The microservice tax is being steadily reduced with\nnew integrations between CMSes, event brokers, and other commonly needed tools.\nBe sure that your organization is prepared to devote the necessary resources to pay\nthese up-front costs.\nSummary\nThis chapter covered the basic requirements behind event-driven microservices. The\nevent broker is the main mechanism of data communication, providing real-time\nevent streams at scale for other services to consume. Containerization and container\nmanagement systems allow for running microservices at scale. Lastly, this chapter\nalso covered the important principles underlying events and event-driven logic and\nprovided a first look at managing state in an distributed event-driven world.\nSummary | 37",

        "page_content": "CHAPTER 3\nCommunication and Data Contracts\nThe fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either\nexactly or approximately a message selected at another point.\n—Claude Shannon\nShannon, known as the Father of Information Theory, identified the largest hurdle of\ncommunication: ensuring that a consumer of a message can accurately reproduce the\nproducer’s message, such that both the content and meaning are correctly conveyed.\nThe producer and consumer must have a common understanding of the message;\notherwise, it may be misinterpreted, and the communication will be incomplete. In\nthe event-driven ecosystem, the event is the message and the fundamental unit of\ncommunication. An event must describe as accurately as possible what happened and\nwhy. It is a statement of fact and, when combined with all the other events in a sys‐\ntem, provides a complete history of what has happened.\nEvent-Driven Data Contracts\nThe format of the data to be communicated and the logic under which it is created\nform the data contract. This contract is followed by both the producer and the con‐\nsumer of the event data. It gives the event meaning and form beyond the context in\nwhich it is produced and extends the usability of the data to consumer applications.\nThere are two components of a well-defined data contract. First is the data definition,\nor what will be produced (i.e., the fields, types, and various data structures). The sec‐\nond component is the triggering logic, or why it is produced (i.e., the specific business\nlogic that triggered the event’s creation). Changes can be made to both the data defi‐\nnition and the triggering logic as the business requirements evolve.\n39",

        "page_content": "Y ou must take care when changing the data definition, so as not to delete or alter\nfields that are being used by downstream consumers. Similarly, you must also be care‐\nful when modifying the triggering logic. It is far more common to change the data\ndefinition than the triggering mechanism, as altering the latter often breaks the\nmeaning of the original event definition.\nUsing Explicit Schemas as Contracts\nThe best way to enforce data contracts and provide consistency is to define a schema\nfor each event. The producer defines an explicit schema detailing the data definition\nand the triggering logic, with all events of the same type adhering to this format. In\ndoing so, the producer provides a mechanism for communicating its event format to\nall prospective consumers. The consumers, in turn, can confidently build their micro‐\nservice business logic against the schematized data.\nAny implementation of event-based communication between a\nproducer and consumer that lacks an explicit predefined schema\nwill inevitably end up relying on an implicit schema. Implicit data\ncontracts are brittle and susceptible to uncontrolled change, which\ncan cause much undue hardship to downstream consumers.\nA consumer must be able to extract the data necessary for its business processes, and\nit cannot do that without having a set of expectations about what data should be\navailable. Consumers must often rely on tribal knowledge and interteam communica‐\ntion to resolve data issues, a process that is not scalable as the number of event\nstreams and teams increases. There is also substantial risk in requiring each con‐\nsumer to independently interpret the data, as a consumer may interpret it differently\nthan its peers, which leads to inconsistent views of the single source of truth.\nIt may be tempting to build a common library that interprets any\ngiven event for all services, but this creates problems with multiple\nlanguage formats, event evolutions, and independent release cycles.\nDuplicating efforts across services to ensure a consistent view of\nimplicitly defined data is nontrivial and best avoided completely.\nProducers are also at a disadvantage with implicit schemas. Even with the best of\nintentions, a producer may not notice (or perhaps their unit tests don’t reveal) that\nthey have altered their event data definition. Without an explicit check of their serv‐\nice’s event format, this situation may go unnoticed until it causes downstream con‐\nsumers to fail. Explicit schemas give security and stability to both consumers and\nproducers.\n40 | Chapter 3: Communication and Data Contracts",

        "page_content": "Schema Definition Comments\nSupport for integrated comments and arbitrary metadata in the schema definition is\nessential for communicating the meaning of an event. The knowledge surrounding\nthe production and consumption of events should be kept as close as possible to the\nevent definition. Schema comments help remove ambiguity about the data’s meaning\nand reduce the chance of misinterpretation by consumers. There are two main areas\nwhere comments are particularly valuable:\n• Specifying the triggering logic of the event. This is typically done in a block\nheader at the top of the schema definition and should clearly state why an event\nhas been generated.\n• Giving context and clarity about a particular field within the structured schema.\nFor example, a datetime field’s comments could specify if the format is UTC, ISO,\nor Unix time.\nFull-Featured Schema Evolution\nThe schema format must support a full range of schema evolution rules. Schema evo‐\nlution enables producers to update their service’s output format while allowing con‐\nsumers to continue consuming the events uninterrupted. Business changes may\nrequire that new fields be added, old fields be deprecated, or the scope of a field be\nexpanded. A schema evolution framework ensures that these changes can occur\nsafely and that producers and consumers can be updated independently of one\nanother.\nUpdates to services become prohibitively expensive without schema evolution sup‐\nport. Producers and consumers are forced to coordinate closely, and old, previously\ncompatible data may no longer be compatible with current systems. It is unreasonable\nto expect consumers to update their services whenever a producer changes the data\nschema. In fact, a core value proposition of microservices is that they should be inde‐\npendent of the release cycles of other services except in exceptional cases.\nAn explicit set of schema evolution rules goes a long way in enabling both consumers\nand producers to update their applications in their own time. These rules are known\nas compatibility types.\nForward compatibility\nAllows for data produced with a newer schema to be read as though it were pro‐\nduced with an older schema. This is a particularly useful evolutionary require‐\nment in an event-driven architecture, as the most common pattern of system\nchange begins with the producer updating its data definition and producing data\nwith the newer schema. The consumer is required only to update its copy of the\nschema and code should it need access to the new fields.\nEvent-Driven Data Contracts | 41",

        "page_content": "Backward compatibility\nAllows for data produced with an older schema to be read as though it were pro‐\nduced with a newer schema. This enables a consumer of data to use a newer\nschema to read older data. There are several scenarios where this is particularly\nuseful:\n• The consumer is expecting a new feature to be delivered by the upstream\nteam. If the new schema is already defined, the consumer can release its own\nupdate prior to the producer release.\n• Schema-encoded data is sent by a product deployed on customer hardware,\nsuch as a cell phone application that reports on user metrics. Updates can be\nmade to the schema format for new producer releases, while maintaining the\ncompatibility with previous releases.\n• The consumer application may need to reprocess data in the event stream\nthat was produced with an older schema version. Schema evolution ensures\nthat the consumer can translate it to a familiar version. If backward compati‐\nbility is not followed, the consumer will only be able to read messages with\nthe latest format.\nFull compatibility\nThe union of forward compatibility and backward compatibility, this is the stron‐\ngest guarantee and the one you should use whenever possible. Y ou can always\nloosen the compatibility requirements at a later date, but it is often far more diffi‐\ncult to tighten them.\nCode Generator Support\nA code generator is used to turn an event schema into a class definition or equivalent\nstructure for a given programming language. This class definition is used by the pro‐\nducer to create and populate new event objects. The producer is required by the com‐\npiler or serializer (depending on the implementation) to respect data types and\npopulate all non-nullable fields that are specified in the original schema. The objects\ncreated by the producer are then converted into their serialized format and sent to the\nevent broker, as shown in Figure 3-1.\nFigure 3-1.

If full compatibility is being observed,\nthe service can use any version of the schema to generate its definitions. The con‐\nsumer reads the event and deserializes it using the schema version that it was enco‐\nded with. The event format is stored either alongside the message, which can be\nprohibitively expensive at scale, or in a schema registry and accessed on-demand (see\n“Schema Registry” on page 241). Once deserialized into its original format, the event\ncan be converted to the version of the schema supported by the consumer. Evolution\nrules come into play at this point, with defaults being applied to missing fields, and\nunused fields dropped completely. Finally, the data is converted into an object based\non the schema-generated class. At this point, the consumer’s business logic may begin\nits operations. This process is shown in Figure 3-2.\nFigure 3-2. Consumer event consumption and conversion workflow using a code genera‐\ntor; note that the consumer converts events from schema v2, as created by the producer,\nto v1, the schema format used by the consumer\nThe biggest benefit of code generator support is being able to write your application\nagainst a class definition in the language of your choice. If you are using a compiled\nlanguage, the code generator provides compiler checks to ensure that you aren’t mis‐\nhandling event types or missing the population of any given non-null data field. Y our\ncode will not compile unless it adheres to the schema, and therefore your application\nwill not be shipped without adhering to the schema data definition. Both compiled\nand noncompiled languages benefit from having a class implementation to code\nagainst. A modern IDE will notify you when you’re trying to pass the wrong types\ninto a constructor or setter, whereas you would receive no notification if you’re\ninstead using a generic format such as an object key/value map. Reducing the risk of\nmishandling data provides for much more consistent data quality across the\necosystem.\nBreaking Schema Changes\nThere are times when the schema definition must change in a way that results in a\nbreaking evolutionary change. This can happen for a number of reasons, including\nevolving business requirements that alter the model of the original domain, improper\nscoping of the original domain, and human error while defining the schema. While\nthe producing service can be fairly easily changed to accommodate the new schema,\nthe impacts to downstream consumers vary and need to be taken into account.\nEvent-Driven Data Contracts | 43",

Ensure that any migration plans have the understanding\nand approval of everyone involved and that no one is caught\nunprepared.\nWhile it may seem heavy-handed to require intense coordination between producers\nand consumers, the renegotiation of the data contract and the alteration of the\ndomain model require buy-in from everyone. Aside from renegotiating the schema,\nyou need to take some additional steps to accommodate the new schema and new\nevent streams that are created from it. Breaking schema changes tend to be quite\nimpactful for entities that exist indefinitely, but less so for events that expire after a\ngiven period of time.\nAccommodating breaking schema changes for entities\nBreaking changes to an entity schema are fairly rare, as this circumstance typically\nrequires a redefinition of the original domain model such that the current model can‐\nnot simply be extended. New entities will be created under the new schema, while\nprevious entities were generated under the old schema. This divergence of data defi‐\nnition leaves you with two choices:\n• Contend with both the old and new schemas.\n• Re-create all entities in the new schema format (via migration, or by re-creating\nthem from source).\nThe first option is the easiest for the producer, but it simply pushes off the resolution\nof the different entity definitions onto the consumer. This contradicts the goal of\nreducing the need for consumers to interpret the data individually and increases the\nrisk of misinterpretation, inconsistent processing between services, and significantly\nhigher complexity in maintaining systems.\nThe reality is that the consumer will never be in a better position\nthan the producer for resolving divergent schema definitions. It is\nbad practice to defer this responsibility to the consumer.\nThe second option is more difficult for the producer, but ensures that the business\nentities, both old and new, are redefined consistently. In practice, the producer must\nreprocess the source data that led to the generation of the old entities and apply the\nnew business logic to re-create the entities under the new format. This approach\nforces the organization as a whole to resolve what these entities mean and how they\nshould be understood and used by producer and consumer alike.\n44 | Chapter 3: Communication and Data Contracts",

        "page_content": "Leave the old entities under the old schema in their original event\nstream, because you may need them for reprocessing validation\nand forensic investigations. Produce the new and updated entities\nusing the new schema to a new stream.\nAccommodating breaking schema changes for events\nNonentity events tend to be simpler to deal with when you are incorporating break‐\ning changes. The simplest option is to create a new event stream and begin producing\nthe new events to that stream. The consumers of the old stream must be notified so\nthat they can register themselves as consumers of the new event stream. Each con‐\nsuming service must also account for the divergence in business logic between the\ntwo event definitions.\nDon’t mix different event types in an event stream, especially event\ntypes that are evolutionarily incompatible. Event stream overhead\nis cheap, and the logical separation is important in ensuring that\nconsumers have full information and explicit definitions when\ndealing with the events they need to process.\nGiven that the old event stream no longer has new events being produced to it, the\nconsumers of each consuming service will eventually catch up to the latest record. As\ntime goes on, the stream’s retention period will eventually result in a full purging of\nthe stream, at which point all consumers can unregister themselves and the event\nstream can be deleted.\nSelecting an Event Format\nWhile there are many options available for formatting and serializing event data, data\ncontracts are best fulfilled with strongly defined formats such as Avro, Thrift, or Pro‐\ntobuf. Some of the most popular event broker frameworks have support for serializ‐\ning and deserializing events encoded with these formats. For example, both Apache\nKafka and Apache Pulsar support JSON, Protobuf, and Avro schema formats. The\nmechanism of support for both of the technologies is the schema registry, which is\ncovered in more detail in “Schema Registry” on page 241. Though a detailed evalua‐\ntion and comparison of these serialization options is beyond the scope of this book,\nthere are a number of online resources available that can help you decide among\nthese particular options.\nY ou may be tempted to choose a more flexible option in the form of plain-text events\nusing simple key/value pairs, which still offers some structure but provides no explicit\nschema or schema evolution frameworks. Proceed cautiously with this approach,\nSelecting an Event Format | 45",

        "page_content": "however, as it can compromise microservices’ ability to remain isolated from one\nanother via a strong data contract, requiring far more interteam communication.\nUnstructured plain-text events usually become a burden to both\nthe producer and the consumer, particularly as use cases and data\nchanges over time. As mentioned, I recommend instead choosing a\nstrongly defined, explicit schema format that supports controlled\nschema evolution, such as Apache Avro or Protobuf. I do not rec‐\nommend JSON, as it does not provide full-compatibility schema\nevolution.\nDesigning Events\nThere are a number of best practices to follow when you are creating event defini‐\ntions, as well as several anti-patterns to avoid. Keep in mind that as the number of\narchitectures powered by event-driven microservices expands, so does the number of\nevent definitions. Well-designed events will minimize the otherwise repetitive pain\npoints for both consumers and producers. With that being said, none of the following\nare hard-and-fast rules. Y ou can break them as you see fit, though I recommend that\nyou think very carefully about the full scope of implications and the tradeoffs for\nyour problem space before proceeding.\nTell the Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth\nA good event definition is not simply a message indicating that something happened,\nbut rather the complete description of everything that happened during that event. In\nbusiness terms, this is the resultant data that is produced when input data is ingested\nand the business logic is applied. This output event must be treated as the single\nsource of truth and must be recorded as an immutable fact for consumption by\ndownstream consumers. It is the full and total authority on what actually occurred,\nand consumers should not need to consult any other source of data to know that such\nan event took place.\nUse a Singular Event Definition per Stream\nAn event stream should contain events representing a single logical event. It is not\nadvisable to mix different types of events within an event stream, because doing so\ncan muddle the definitions of what the event is and what the stream represents. It is\ndifficult to validate the schemas being produced, as new schemas may be added\ndynamically in such a scenario. Though there are special circumstances where you\nmay wish to ignore this principle, the vast majority of event streams produced and\nconsumed within your architectural workflow should each have a strict, single\ndefinition.\n46 | Chapter 3: Communication and Data Contracts",

        "page_content": "Use the Narrowest Data Types\nUse the narrowest types for your event data. This lets you rely on the code generators,\nlanguage type checking (if supported), and serialization unit tests to check the\nboundaries of your data. It sounds simple, but there are many cases where ambiguity\ncan creep in when you don’t use the proper types. Here are a few easily avoidable real-\nworld examples:\nUsing string to store a numeric value\nThis requires the consumer to parse and convert the string to a numeric value\nand often comes up with GPS coordinates. This is error prone and subject to fail‐\nures, especially when a null value or an empty string is sent.\nUsing integer as a boolean\nWhile 0 and 1 can be used to denote false and true, respectively, what does 2\nmean? How about -1?\nUsing string as an enum\nThis is problematic for producers, as they must ensure that their published values\nmatch an accepted pseudo-enum list. Typos and incorrect values will inevitably\nbe introduced. A consumer interested in this field will need to know the range of\npossible values, and this will require talking to the producing team, unless it’s\nspecified in the comments of the schema. In either case, this is an implicit defini‐\ntion, since the producers are not guarded against any changes to the range of val‐\nues in the string. This whole approach is simply bad practice.\nEnums are often avoided because producers fear creating a new enum token that isn’t\npresent in the consumer’s schema. However, the consumer has a responsibility to\nconsider enum tokens that it does not recognize, and determine if it should process\nthem using a default value or simply throw a fatal exception and halt processing until\nsomeone can work out what needs to be done. Both Protobuf and Avro have elegant\nways of handling unknown enum tokens and should be used if either is selected for\nyour event format.\nKeep Events Single-Purpose\nOne common anti-pattern is adding a type field to an event definition, where differ‐\nent type values indicate specific subfeatures of the event. This is generally done for\ndata that is “similar yet different” and is often a result of the implementer incorrectly\nidentifying the events as single-purpose. Though it may seem like a time-saving\nmeasure or a simplification of a data access pattern, overloading events with type\nparameters is rarely a good idea.\nThere are several problems with this approach. Each type parameter value usually\nhas a fundamentally different business meaning, even if its technical representation is\nDesigning Events | 47",

Some of these types may require\nthe addition of new parameters to track type-specific information, whereas other\ntypes require separate parameters. Eventually you could have a situation where there\nare several very distinct events all inhabiting the same event schema, making it diffi‐\ncult to reason about what the event truly represents.\nThis complexity affects not only the developers who must maintain and populate\nthese events, but also the data’s consumers, who need to have a consistent under‐\nstanding about what data is published and why. If the data contract changes, they\nexpect to be able to isolate themselves from those changes. Adding extra field types\nrequires them to filter for only data that they care about. There is a risk that the con‐\nsumer will fail to fully understand the various meanings of the types, leading to\nincorrect consumption and logically wrong code. For each consumer, additional pro‐\ncessing must also be done to discard events that aren’t relevant to that consumer.\nIt is very important to note that adding type fields does not reduce\nor eliminate the underlying complexity inherent in the data being\nproduced. In fact, this complexity is merely shifted from multiple\ndistinct event streams with distinct schemas to a union of all the\nschemas merged into one event stream. It could be argued that this\nactually increases the complexity. Future evolution of the schema\nbecomes more difficult, as does maintaining the code that produces\nthe events.\nRemember the principles of the data contract definition. Events should be related to a\nsingle business action, not a generic event that records large assortments of data. If it\nseems like you need a generic event with various type parameters, that’s usually a tell-\ntale sign that your problem space and bounded context is not well defined.\nExample: Overloading event definitions\nImagine a simple website where a user can read a book or watch a movie. When the\nuser first engages the website, say by opening the book or starting the movie, a back‐\nend service publishes an event of this engagement, named ProductEngagement, into\nan event stream. The data structure of this cautionary tale event may look something\nlike this:\nTypeEnum: Book, Movie\nActionEnum: Click\nProductEngagement {\n  productId: Long,\n  productType: TypeEnum,\n  actionType: ActionEnum\n}\n48 | Chapter 3: Communication and Data Contracts",

Adding extra field types can shift this complexity from multiple distinct event streams to a union of all schemas merged into one stream. This can actually increase complexity and make future evolution of the schema more difficult. Events should be related to a single business action, not a generic event that records large amounts of data. Overloading event definitions can lead to poor design. An example of this is a ProductEngagement event with type parameters for book and movie, which may indicate a poorly defined problem space and bounded context.",

Again, because there is only a\nsingle defined structure of events for product engagements, your course of action is\nconstrained to adding a new action entity ( Bookmark) and adding a nullable PageId\nfield.\nTypeEnum: Book, Movie\nActionEnum: Click, Bookmark\nProductEngagement {\n  productId: Long,\n  productType: TypeEnum,\n  actionType: ActionEnum,\n  //Only applies to productType=Movie\n  watchedPreview: {null, Boolean},\n  //Only applies to productType=Book,actionType=Bookmark\n  pageId: {null, Int}\n}\nAs you can see by now, just a few changes in business requirements can greatly com‐\nplicate a schema that is trying to serve multiple business purposes. This adds com‐\nplexity for the producer and the consumer of the data, as they both must check for\nthe validity of the data logic. The data to be collected and represented will always be\ncomplex, but by following single responsibility principles you can decompose the\nschema into something more manageable. Let’s see what this example would look like\nif you split up each schema according to single responsibilities:\nMovieClick {\n  movieId: Long,\n  watchedPreview: Boolean\n}\nDesigning Events | 49",

There are now three event definitions instead of just a\nsingle one, and while the schema definition count has increased, the internal com‐\nplexity of each schema is greatly reduced. Following the recommendation of one\nevent definition per stream would see the creation of a new stream for each event\ntype. Event definitions would not drift over time, the triggering logic would not\nchange, and consumers could be secure in the stability of the single-purpose event\ndefinition.\nThe takeaway from this example is not that the original creator of the event definition\nmade a mistake. In fact, at the time, the business cared about any product engage‐\nments but no specific product engagement, so the original definition is quite reason‐\nable. As soon as the business requirements changed to include tracking movie-\nspecific events, the owner of the service needed to re-evaluate whether the event\ndefinition was still serving a single purpose, or if it was instead now covering multiple\npurposes. Due to the business requiring lower-level details of an event, it became\nclear that, while the event could serve multiple purposes, it soon would become com‐\nplex and unwieldy to do so.\nAvoid adding type fields in your events that overload the meaning\nof the event. This can cause significant difficulty in evolving and\nmaintaining the event format.\nTake some time to consider how your schemas may evolve. Identify the main busi‐\nness purpose of the data being produced, the scope, the domain, and whether you’re\nbuilding it as single-purpose. Validate that the schemas accurately reflect business\nconcerns, especially for systems that cover a broad scope of business function respon‐\nsibility. It could be that the business scope and the technical implementation are mis‐\naligned. Finally, evolving business requirements may require you to revisit the event\ndefinitions and potentially change them beyond just incremental definitions of a sin‐\ngle schema. Events may need to be split up and redefined completely should sufficient\nbusiness changes occur.\n50 | Chapter 3: Communication and Data Contracts",

        "page_content": "Minimize the Size of Events\nEvents work well when they’re small, well defined, and easily processed. Large events\ncan and do happen, though. Generally these larger events represent a lot of contextual\ninformation. Perhaps they comprise many data points that are related to the given\nevent, and are simply a very large measurement of something that occurred.\nThere are several considerations when you’re looking at a design that produces a very\nlarge event. Make sure that the data is directly related and relevant to the event. Addi‐\ntional data may have been added to an event “just in case, ” but it may not be of any\nreal use to the downstream consumers. If you find that all the event data is indeed\ndirectly related, take a step back and look at your problem space. Does your microser‐\nvice require access to the data? Y ou may want to evaluate the bounded context to see\nif the service is performing a reasonable amount of work. Perhaps the service could\nbe reduced in scope with additional functionality split off into its own service.\nThis scenario is not always avoidable, though—some event processors produce very\nlarge output files (perhaps a large image) that are much too big to fit into a single\nmessage of an event stream. In these scenarios you can use a pointer to the actual\ndata, but do this sparingly. This approach adds risk in the form of multiple sources of\ntruth and payload mutability, as an immutable ledger cannot ensure the preservation\nof data outside of its system.\nInvolve Prospective Consumers in the Event Design\nWhen designing a new event, it is important to involve any anticipated consumers of\nthis data. Consumers will understand their own needs and anticipated business func‐\ntions better than the producers and may help in clarifying requirements. Consumers\nwill also get a better understanding of the data coming their way. A joint meeting or\ndiscussion can shake out any issues around the data contract between the two\nsystems.\nAvoid Events as Semaphores or Signals\nAvoid using events as a semaphore or a signal. These events simply indicate that\nsomething has occurred without being the single source of truth for the results.\nConsider a very simple example where a system outputs an event indicating that\nwork has been completed for an arbitrary job. Although the event itself indicates the\nwork is done, the actual result of the work is not included in the event. This means\nthat to consume this event properly, you must find where the completed work\nactually resides. Once there are two sources of truth for a piece of data, consistency\nproblems arise.\nDesigning Events | 51",

        "page_content": "Summary\nAsynchronous event-driven architectures rely heavily upon event quality. High-\nquality events are explicitly defined with an evolvable schema, have well-defined trig‐\ngering logic, and include full schema definitions with comments and documentation.\nImplicit schemas, while easier to implement and maintain for the producer, offload\nmuch of the interpretation work onto the consumer. They are also more prone to\nunexpected failures due to missing event data and unintentional changes. Explicit\nschemas are an essential component for widespread adoption of event-driven archi‐\ntectures, particularly as an organization grows and it becomes impossible to commu‐\nnicate tribal knowledge organization-wide.\nEvent definitions should be narrow and closely focused on the domain of the event.\nAn event should represent a specific business occurrence and contain the appropriate\ndata fields to record what has happened. These events form the official narrative\nabout business operations and can be consumed by other microservices for their own\nneeds.\nSchema evolution is a very important aspect of explicit schemas, as it allows for a\ncontrolled mechanism of change for the event domain model. It is common for a\ndomain model to evolve, particularly as new business requirements emerge and the\norganization expands. Schema evolution allows producers and consumers to isolate\nthemselves from changes that aren’t essential to their operations, while permitting\nthose services that do care about the changes to update themselves accordingly.\nIn some cases schema evolution is not possible, and a breaking change must occur.\nThe producer and consumer stakeholders must communicate the reasons behind the\nbreaking changes and come together to redefine the domain model going forward.\nMigration of old events may or may not be necessary.\n52 | Chapter 3: Communication and Data Contracts",

        "page_content": "INTRODUCTION\nKubernetes is an open-source, container management \nsolution originally announced by Google in 2014. \nAfter its initial release in July 2015, Google donated \nKubernetes to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. \nSince then, several stable versions have been released \nunder Apache License.\nFor a developer, Kubernetes provides a manageable \nexecution environment for deploying, running, \nmanaging, and orchestrating containers across clusters \nor clusters of hosts. For devops and administrators, \nKubernetes provides a complete set of building \nblocks that allow the automation of many operations \nfor managing development, test, and production \nenvironments. Container orchestration enables \ncoordinating containers in clusters consisting of multiple \nnodes when complex containerized applications \nare deployed. This is relevant not only for the initial \ndeployment, but also for managing multiple containers \nas a single entity for the purposes of scaling, \navailability, and so on.\nBeing infrastructure agnostic, Kubernetes clusters can \nbe installed on a variety of public and private clouds \n(AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, OpenStack) and on bare \nmetal servers. Additionally, Google Container Engine \ncan provide a deployed Kubernetes cluster. This makes \nKubernetes similar to Linux kernel, which provides \nconsistency across different hardware platforms, or \nJava, which runs on almost any operating system. \nStratoscale\n3\nEverything Kubernetes: A Practical Guide",

The control plane  \nconsists of different processes, such as an API server (provides JSON over HTTP API), scheduler (selects nodes to run \ncontainers), controller manager (runs controllers, see below), and etcd (a globally available configuration store).\nDASHBOARD AND CLI\nA Kubernetes cluster can be managed via the Kubernetes Dashboard, a web UI running on the master node. The cluster \ncan also be managed via the command line tool kubectl, which can be installed on any machine able to access the API \nserver, running on the master node.

For example:\nrelease: stable\nenvironment: dev\nenvironment = dev\nenvironment != live\nenvironment in (dev, test)\nenvironment notin (live)\nrelease = stable, environment = dev\nSERVICE DISCOVERY\nKubernetes supports finding a service in two ways: through environment variables and using DNS.\nKubernetes automatically assigns DNS names to services. A special DNS record can be used to specify port numbers \nas well. To use DNS for service discovery, a Kubernetes cluster should be properly configured to support it.\nAn application in the pod can use these variables to establish a connection to the service.\nThe service should be created before the replication controller or replica set creates a pod’s replicas. Changes made to \nan active service are not reflected in a previously created replica. \nENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\nDNS\nKubernetes injects a set of environment variables into pods for each active service.

        "page_content": "LOGGING\nBasic logging in Kubernetes behaves much like logging in Docker. There is a kubectl logs command that \nwill show you all the information written to stdout and stderr for a given container in a pod. If a pod has \nonly one container, there is no need to specify it explicitly, however when a pod has several containers \nwe need to add -c container to the end of the command. As with Docker, we can opt to follow \nlogs, to reduce the number of recent lines with --tail and we can filter them by date. Unlike Docker, \nKubernetes enables us to  check the logs of a container that crashed using the --previous option.\nThe ability to keep the logs of a previous container is available as long as the pod it was run in remains \navailable. When a pod is removed, so are its logs. \nLog rotation is performed by Kubernetes. The default values are daily rotation or 10 MB to avoid log files \ntaking up all the available disk space. Up to five rotations are kept for historical evidence. Remember that \nonly the last rotation is displayed with kubectl logs; if you want to access an earlier one, you must do so \nmanually.\nPer our example with the Hello Minikube service, we can use kubectl logs hello-minikube-\n2433534028-ouxw8 to view the access log containing our curl request.\nAll information so far concerns per-node log files. There are no cluster-level logging capabilities built into \nKubernetes, but there are some common methods that can be implemented for this purpose.\nIn this approach, a logging agent is run on every node, preferably through a DeamonSet replica. A \npopular choice in this space is fluentd. It can be configured with various backends among which are \nGoogle Cloud Platform and Elasticsearch.\nFluentd even goes as far as to provide a ready to use DaemonSet YAML on GitHub. All that needs \nto be done is edit its configuration to point at our logging backend.\nThere are several use cases for this approach. The general idea is that a dedicated logging \ncomponent in each pod either writes logs to its stdout and stderr or delivers the logs directly to a \nlogging backend. With such a sidecar approach, we can aggregate all logs from different containers \nin a pod to a single stream that can be accessed with kubectl logs or we can split logs of one \napplication into different logical streams. For example, Webservers’ access.log and error.log can each  \nbe streamed by a dedicated container to its stdout, so we can check them separately with kubectl \nlogs $podname -c access-log and kubectl logs $podname -c error-log.\nIf the application running in a pod can already communicate with a logging backend, it is possible to \nskip the Kubernetes logging options altogether. While direct logging may offer some performance \nadvantages and provide slightly better security (all data stored in just one place), it also prevents us \nfrom using kubectl logs. In most cases, this approach is discouraged.\nDEDICATED AGENT RUNNING ON EVERY NODE\nDEDICATED CONTAINER INSIDE A POD\nDIRECT LOGGING FROM AN APPLICATION\nStratoscale\n18\nEverything Kubernetes: A Practical Guide",

Basic tools, such as top or kubectl top, will behave as expected. It’s also \npossible to use solutions that are dedicated to Kubernetes. One such solution is Heapster. Heapster \naggregates events and data from across the cluster. It runs as a pod in system namespace. Discovery \nand querying of resources is done automatically with data coming from a kubelet managing node. \nStorage is configurable with InfluxDB and Google Cloud Monitoring being the most popular choices. \nWhen building a DIY cluster  InfluxDB with Grafana for visualization is the preferred choice. Using \nit with Minikube requires two easy steps. First, enable the Heapster addon (minikube addons \nenable heapster) by opening the dashboard with Minikube addons. Then open Heapster. \nBy default, dashboards are available for Cluster and for Pods, one for monitoring running nodes and \noverall cluster utilization, the other for running pods. The information presented for pods includes \nCPU usage, memory usage, network usage, and filesystem usage. It is possible to edit existing graphs \nor add custom ones based on data exported by Heapster.\nSo far, we have used kubectl to connect to only one cluster created by Minikube. But kubectl can \nbe configured to use multiple clusters and multiple contexts to connect to them. To check available \ncontexts, we use kubectl config get-contexts.\n  \nWe can confirm that only one context and only one cluster is defined by kubectl config view.

        "page_content": "DIY CLUSTER \nCONSIDERATIONS\nHIGH AVAILABILITY\nPossible cases of failure in Kubernetes clusters usually point to pods, nodes, and master nodes. Pod failures can be \nhandled by built-in Kubernetes features, so the main concern here is to provide persistent storage if needed. Node \nfailures can be handled by master nodes and require use of services outside of Kubernetes. For example, kubelet \ntalks to an external load-balancer rather than directly to clients; if the entire node fails, traffic can be load balanced \nto the node with corresponding pods. Finally, the master controller can fail, or one of its services can die. We need to \nreplicate the master controller and its components for a Highly Available environment. Fortunately, multiple master \nnodes are also accounted for in Kubernetes. \nFurthermore,  when it comes to monitoring the deployment, It is advisable that process watchers be implemented \nto “watch” the services that exist on the master node. For example, the API service can be monitored by a kubelet. It \ncan be configured with less aggressive security settings to monitor non-Kubernetes components such as privileged \ncontainers. On a different level is the issue of what happens if a kubelet dies. Monitoring processes can be deployed  \nto ensure that the kubelet can be restarted. Finally, redundant storage service can be achieved with clustered etcd.\nWhat if you need a production ready Kubernetes \ncluster, but for some reason you cannot use the \nexisting cloud offerings, such as Google Container \nEngine? Kubernetes can be installed on a variety \nplatforms, including on-premises VMs, VMs on a \ncloud provider, and bare-metal servers. There are \nseveral tools that allow installing production ready \nKubernetes cluster on a variety of targets:\n• kargo \n• kube-deploy \n• kube-admin \nWhen deploying a Kubernetes cluster in production, \none should take care of several things to ensure the \nbest possible outcome. High Availability of master \nnodes helps minimize downtime and data loss as \nwell as eliminates single point of failure. Networking \nshould be both robust and scalable to handle growing \nneeds (e.g., The number of nodes in a cluster to handle \nmore replicas). Finally, some users may want to take \nadvantage of multi-site support to uniformly handle \ngeographically dispersed data centers.\nStratoscale\n33\nEverything Kubernetes: A Practical Guide",

RAG\nsystems are composed of a retrieval and an\nLLM based generation module, and provide\nLLMs with knowledge from a reference textual\ndatabase, which enables them to act as a natu-\nral language layer between a user and textual\ndatabases, reducing the risk of hallucinations.\nEvaluating RAG architectures is, however, chal-\nlenging because there are several dimensions to\nconsider: the ability of the retrieval system to\nidentify relevant and focused context passages,\nthe ability of the LLM to exploit such passages\nin a faithful way, or the quality of the gener-\nation itself. With RAGA S, we put forward a\nsuite of metrics which can be used to evaluate\nthese different dimensions without having to\nrely on ground truth human annotations. We\nposit that such a framework can crucially con-\ntribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG archi-\ntectures, which is especially important given\nthe fast adoption of LLMs.\n1 Introduction\nLanguage Models (LMs) capture a vast amount\nof knowledge about the world, which allows them\nto answer questions without accessing any exter-\nnal sources. This idea of LMs as repositories of\nknowledge emerged shortly after the introduction\nof BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more\nfirmly established with the introduction of ever\nlarger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most\nrecent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture\nenough knowledge to rival human performance\nacross a wide variety of question answering bench-\nmarks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using\nLLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen-\ntal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer\nquestions about events that have happened after\nthey were trained. Second, even the largest models\nstruggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely\nmentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al.,\n2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution\nto these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al.,\n2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question\nthen essentially involves retrieving relevant pas-\nsages from a corpus and feeding these passages,\nalong with the original question, to the LM. While\ninitial approaches relied on specialised LMs for\nretrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel-\nwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work\nhas suggested that simply adding retrieved docu-\nments to the input of a standard LM can also work\nwell (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi\net al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval-\naugmented strategies in combination with LLMs\nthat are only available through APIs.\nWhile the usefulness of retrieval-augmented\nstrategies is clear, their implementation requires\na significant amount of tuning, as the overall per-\nformance will be affected by the retrieval model,\nthe considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for-\nmulation, among others. Automated evaluation of\nretrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In\npractice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms\nof the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea-\nsuring perplexity on some reference corpus. How-\never, such evaluations are not always predictive\nof downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c).\nMoreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM\nprobabilities, which are not accessible for some\nclosed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques-\ntion answering is another common evaluation task,\nbut usually only datasets with short extractive an-\nswers are considered, which may not be represen-\ntative of how the system will be used.\nTo address these issues, in this paper we present\nRAGA S1, a framework for the automated assess-\n1RAGA S is available at https://github.com/\nexplodinggradients/ragas.\narXiv:2309.15217v1  [cs.CL]  26 Sep 2023",

RAG systems combine retrieval and LLM-based generation modules. Evaluating RAG architectures is challenging due to various dimensions, including retrieval system performance and LLM exploitation. RAGA S provides a suite of metrics for evaluating these dimensions without human annotations. This framework can contribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures, which is important given the fast adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current evaluation methods have limitations, such as relying on ground truth human annotations and being non-predictive of downstream performance.

The RAGA S\nframework provides an integration with both llama-\nindex and Langchain, the most widely used frame-\nworks for building RAG solutions, thus enabling\ndevelopers to easily integrate RAGA S into their\nstandard workflow.\n2 Related Work\nEstimating faithfulness using LLMsThe prob-\nlem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated\nresponses has been extensively studied (Ji et al.,\n2023). Several authors have suggested the idea\nof predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt-\ning strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy-\nses, however, suggest that existing models struggle\nwith detecting hallucination when using standard\nprompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and\nMitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking\nthe generated responses to facts from an external\nknowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not\nalways possible.\nYet another strategy is to inspect the probabili-\nties assigned to individual tokens, where we would\nexpect the model to be less confident in halluci-\nnated answers than in factual ones. For instance,\nBARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality\nby looking at the conditional probability of the gen-\nerated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022)\nuse a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob-\nservation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba-\nbilities when answering multiple-choice questions,\nthey essentially convert the problem of validating\nmodel generated answers into a multiple-choice\nquestion which asks whether the answer is true or\nfalse. Rather than looking at the output probabil-\nities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train\na supervised classifier on the weights from one of\nthe hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a\ngiven statement is true or not. While the approach\nperforms well, the need to access the hidden states\nof the model makes it unsuitable for systems that\naccess LLMs through an API.\nFor models that do not provide access to token\nprobabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, differ-\nent methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul\net al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sam-\npling multiple answers. Their core idea is that\nfactual answers are more stable: when an answer is\nfactual, we can expect that different samples will\ntend to be semantically similar, whereas this is less\nlikely to be the case for hallucinated answers.\nAutomated evaluation of text generation systems\nLLMs have also been leveraged to automatically\nevaluate other aspects of generated text fragments,\nbeyond factuality. For instance, GPTScore (Fu\net al., 2023) uses a prompt that specifies the consid-\nered aspect (e.g. fluency) and then scores passages\nbased on the average probability of the generated\ntokens, according to a given autoregressive LM.\nThis idea of using prompts was previously also\nconsidered by Yuan et al. (2021), although they\nused a smaller fine-tuned LM (i.e. BART) and did\nnot observe a clear benefit from using prompts. An-\nother approach directly asks ChatGPT to evaluate\na particular aspect of the given answer by provid-\ning a score between 0 and 100, or by providing a\nrating on a 5-star scale (Wang et al., 2023a). Re-\nmarkably, strong results can be obtained in this\nway, although it comes with the limitation of being\nsensitive to the design of the prompt. Rather than\nscoring individual answers, some authors have also\nfocused on using an LLM to select the best answer\namong a number of candidates (Wang et al., 2023b),\ntypically to compare the performance of different\nLLMs. However, care is needed with this approach,\nas the order in which the answers is presented can\ninfluence the result (Wang et al., 2023b).\nIn terms of how ground truth answers or, more\ngenerally, generations, have been typically used\nin the literature, most approaches have relied on\nthe availability of one or more reference answers.\nFor instance, BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020)\nand MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) use contex-\ntualised embeddings, produced by a pre-trained\nBERT model, to compare the similarity between\nthe generated answer and the reference answers.\nBARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) similarly uses refer-\nence answers to compute aspects such as precision\n(estimated as the probability of generating the gen-\nerated answer given the reference) and recall (esti-\nmated as the probability of generating the reference\ngiven the generated answer).\n3 Evaluation Strategies\nWe consider a standard RAG setting, where given a\nquestion q, the system first retrieves some context\nc(q) and then uses the retrieved context to generate\nan answer as(q).

        "page_content": "we usually do not have access to human-annotated\ndatasets or reference answers. We therefore fo-\ncus on metrics that are fully self-contained and\nreference-free. We focus in particular three quality\naspects, which we argue are of central importance.\nFirst, Faithfulness refers to the idea that the an-\nswer should be grounded in the given context. This\nis important to avoid hallucinations, and to ensure\nthat the retrieved context can act as a justification\nfor the generated answer. Indeed, RAG systems are\noften used in applications where the factual con-\nsistency of the generated text w.r.t. the grounded\nsources is highly important, e.g. in domains such as\nlaw, where information is constantly evolving. Sec-\nond, Answer Relevancerefers to the idea that the\ngenerated answer should address the actual ques-\ntion that was provided. Finally,Context Relevance\nrefers to the idea that the retrieved context should\nbe focused, containing as little irrelevant informa-\ntion as possible. This is important given the cost\nassociated with feeding long context passages to\nLLMs. Moreover, when context passages are too\nlong, LLMs are often less effective in exploiting\nthat context, especially for information that is pro-\nvided in the middle of the context passage (Liu\net al., 2023).\nWe now explain how these three quality aspects\ncan be measured in a fully automated way, by\nprompting an LLM. In our implementation and\nexperiments, all prompts are evaluated using the\ngpt-3.5-turbo-16k model, which is available\nthrough the OpenAI API2.\nFaithfulness We say that the answer as(q) is\nfaithful to the context c(q) if the claims that are\nmade in the answer can be inferred from the con-\ntext. To estimate faithfulness, we first use an LLM\nto extract a set of statements, S(as(q)). The aim\nof this step is to decompose longer sentences into\nshorter and more focused assertions. We use the\nfollowing prompt for this step3:\nGiven a question and answer, create one\nor more statements from each sentence\nin the given answer.\nquestion: [question]\nanswer: [answer]\nwhere [question] and [answer] refer to the\ngiven question and answer. For each statement si\n2https://platform.openai.com\n3To help clarify the task, we include a demonstration as\npart of the prompt. This demonstration is not explicitly shown\nin the listing of the prompts throughout this paper.\nin S, the LLM determines ifsi can be inferred from\nc(q) using a verification function v(si, c(q)). This\nverification step is carried out using the following\nprompt:\nConsider the given context and following\nstatements, then determine whether they\nare supported by the information present\nin the context. Provide a brief explana-\ntion for each statement before arriving\nat the verdict (Yes/No). Provide a final\nverdict for each statement in order at the\nend in the given format. Do not deviate\nfrom the specified format.\nstatement: [statement 1]\n...\nstatement: [statement n]\nThe final faithfulness score, F, is then computed\nas F = |V |\n|S| , where |V | is the number of statements\nthat were supported according to the LLM and |S|\nis the total number of statements.\nAnswer relevance We say that the answer as(q)\nis relevant if it directly addresses the question in\nan appropriate way. In particular, our assessment\nof answer relevance does not take into account fac-\ntuality, but penalises cases where the answer is\nincomplete or where it contains redundant informa-\ntion. To estimate answer relevance, for the given\nanswer as(q), we prompt the LLM to generate n\npotential questions qi based on as(q), as follows:\nGenerate a question for the given answer.\nanswer: [answer]\nWe then obtain embeddings for all questions us-\ning the text-embedding-ada-002 model, avail-\nable from the OpenAI API. For each qi, we cal-\nculate the similarity sim(q, qi) with the original\nquestion q, as the cosine between the correspond-\ning embeddings. The answer relevance score, AR,\nfor question q is then computed as:\nAR = 1\nn\nnX\ni=1\nsim(q, qi) (1)\nThis metric evaluates how closely the generated\nanswer aligns with the initial question or instruc-\ntion.\nContext relevance The context c(q) is consid-\nered relevant to the extent that it exclusively con-\ntains information that is needed to answer the ques-\ntion. In particular, this metric aims to penalise the",

We\ncan then verify to what extent our metrics agree\nwith human assessments of faithfulness, answer\nrelevance and context relevance. Since we are not\naware of any publicly available datasets that could\nbe used for this purpose, we created a new dataset,\nwhich we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the\ndataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov-\nering events that have happened since the start of\n20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised\nthose with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages,\nwe then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that\ncan be answered based on the introductory section\nof the page, using the following prompt:\nYour task is to formulate a question from\ngiven context satisfying the rules given\nbelow:\n1. The question should be fully answered\nfrom the given context.\n2. The question should be framed from\na part that contains non-trivial informa-\ntion.\n3.

Do not use phrases that ’provided con-\ntext’, etc in the question\ncontext:\nWe also used ChatGPT to answer the generated\nquestion, when given the corresponding introduc-\ntory section as context, using the following prompt:\nAnswer the question using the informa-\ntion from the given context.\nquestion: [question]\ncontext: [context]\nAll questions were annotated along the three con-\nsidered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both\nannotators were fluent in English and were given\nclear instructions about the meaning of the three\nconsidered quality dimensions. For faithfulness\nand context relevance, the two annotators agreed in\naround 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they\nagreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements\nwere resolved after a discussion between the anno-\ntators.\nFaithfulness To obtain human judgements about\nfaithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the\nquestion without access to any additional context.\nWe then asked the annotators to judge which of the\ntwo answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard\none or the one generated without context), given\nthe question and corresponding Wikipedia page.\nAnswer relevance We first used ChatGPT to\nobtain candidate answers with lower answer rel-\nevance, using the following prompt:\nAnswer the given question in an incom-\nplete manner.\nquestion: [question]\nWe then asked human annotators to compare this\nanswer, and indicate which of the two answers had\nthe highest answer relevance.\nContext relevance To measure this aspect, we\nfirst added additional sentences to the context by\nscraping back-links to the corresponding Wikipedia\npage.

For the few pages with-\nout any back-links, we instead used ChatGPT to\ncomplete the given context.\n5 Experiments\nTable 1 analyses the agreement between the met-\nrics proposed in Section 3 and the human assess-\nments from the proposed WikiEval dataset. Each\nWikiEval instance requires the model to compare\ntwo answers or two context fragments. We count\nhow often the answer/context preferred by the\nmodel (i.e. with highest estimated faithfulness, an-\nswer relevance, or context relevance) coincides\nwith the answer/context preferred by the human\nannotators. We report the results in terms of ac-\ncuracy (i.e. the fraction of instances on which the\nmodel agrees with the annotators).\nTo put the results in context, we compare our\nproposed metrics (shown asRAGAs in Table 1) with\ntwo baseline methods. For the first method, shown\nas GPT Score, we ask ChatGPT to assign a score\nbetween 0 and 10 for the three quality dimensions.\nTo this end, we use a prompt that describes the\nmeaning of the quality metric and then asks to\nscore the given answer/context in line with that\ndefinition. For instance, for evaluating faithfulness,\nwe used the following prompt:\nFaithfulness measures the information\nconsistency of the answer against the\ngiven context. Any claims that are made\nin the answer that cannot be deduced\nfrom context should be penalized.\nGiven an answer and context, assign a\nscore for faithfulness in the range 0-10.\ncontext: [context]\nanswer: [answer]\nTies, where the same score is assigned by the LLM\nto both answer candidates, were broken randomly.\nThe second baseline, shown as GPT Ranking, in-\nstead asks ChatGPT to select the preferred answer/-\ncontext. In this case, the prompt again includes\na definition of the considered quality metric. For\ninstance, for evaluating answer relevance, we used\nthe following prompt:\nAnswer Relevancy measures the degree\nto which a response directly addresses\nand is appropriate for a given question.\nIt penalizes the present of redundant in-\nformation or incomplete answers given a\nquestion. Given an question and answer,\nrank each answer based on Answer Rele-\nvancy.\nquestion: [question]\nanswer 1: [answer 1]\nanswer 2: [answer 2]\nThe results in Table 1 show that our proposed\nmetrics are much closer aligned with the human\njudgements than the predictions from the two base-\nlines. For faithfulness, the RAGAs prediction are\nin general highly accurate. For answer relevance,\nthe agreement is lower, but this is largely due to the\nfact that the differences between the two candidate\nanswers are often very subtle. We found context\nrelevance to be the hardest quality dimension to\nevaluate. In particular, we observed that ChatGPT\noften struggles with the task of selecting the sen-\ntences from the context that are crucial, especially\nfor longer contexts.\n6 Conclusions\nWe have highlighted the need for automated\nreference-free evaluation of RAG systems. In par-\nticular, we have argued the need for an evaluation\nframework that can assess faithfulness (i.e. is the\nanswer grounded in the retrieved context), answer\nrelevance (i.e. does the answer address the ques-\ntion) and context relevance (i.e. is the retrieved\ncontext sufficiently focused). To support the devel-\nopment of such a framework, we have introduced\nWikiEval, a dataset which human judgements of\nthese three different aspects. Finally, we have also\ndescribed RAGAs, our implementation of the three\nconsidered quality aspects. This framework is easy\nto use and can provide deverlopers of RAG sys-\ntems with valuable insights, even in the absence\nof any ground truth. Our evaluation on WikiEval\nhas shown that the predictions from RAGAs are\nclosely aligned with human predictions, especially\nfor faithfulness and answer relevance.",

However, existing research lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on different large language models, which make it challeng- ing to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systemati- cally investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Gener- ation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different large language models in 4 fundamental abili- ties required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robust- ness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the afore- mentioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diag- nose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to ef- fectively apply RAG to LLMs. Introduction Recently, there have been impressive advancements in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) and ChatGLM (THUDM 2023a). Although these models have shown remarkable general abilities (Bang et al. 2023; Guo et al. 2023), they still suffer severely from challenges includ- ing factual hallucination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes, and Junczys-Dowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023), knowledge out- dating (He, Zhang, and Roth 2022), and the lack of domain- specific expertise (Li et al. 2023c; Shen et al. 2023). Incorporating external knowledge via information re- trieval, i.e., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), has been regarded as a promising way to resolve the above chal- lenges.

With the help of external knowl- edge, LLMs can generate more accurate and reliable re- sponses. The most common method is to use a search engine as a retriever such as New Bing. Due to the vast amount of information available on the Internet, using a search engine can provide more real-time information. However, Retrieval-Augmented Generation brings not only positive effects to LLMs (Liu, Zhang, and Liang 2023; Maynez et al. 2020). On one hand, there is a significant amount of noise information even fake news in the content available on the Internet, which poses challenges for search engines in accurately retrieving desirable knowledge. On the other hand, LLMs suffer from unreliable generation chal- lenge.

        "page_content": "formation. These challenges result in LLMs being unable to consistently generate reliable and accurate responses. Un- fortunately, currently there lacks of comprehensive under- standing on how these factors can influence RAG, and how could each model survives from these drawbacks and im- provement their performance via information retrieval. As a result, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive evalua- tion of LLMs on their ability to effectively utilize retrieved information, as well as their ability to withstand the various drawbacks present in information retrieval. To this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive evalua- tion of RAG for current LLMs. Specifically, we create a new Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark, namely RGB, in both English and Chinese. In order to ensure that the in- ternal knowledge of LLMs does not introduce bias into the evaluation results, RGB chooses to aggregate the latest news information and constructs queries based on the news infor- mation. Then, based on these queries, we use Search API to fetch relevant documents and select most relevant snippets from the content as external retrieved documents. Finally, based on different compositions of query and document-set pairs, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the following basic abilities of LLMs according to the common challenges in RAG, as shown in Figure 1: • Noise Robustness, which means a LLM can extract use- ful information from noisy documents. In this paper, we define noisy documents as those that are relevant to the question but do not contain any information of the an- swer. For the instance in Figure 1, the noisy documents related to the question “Who was awarded the 2022 No- bel Prize in Literature” include reports about the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature. To this end, the testbed for noise robustness contains instances whose external doc- uments contain a certain number of noisy documents based on the desired noise ratio. • Negative Rejection, which means that a LLM should re- ject to answer the question when the required knowledge is not present in any retrieved document. The testbed for negative rejection contains instances whose external doc- uments are only with noisy documents. LLMs are ex- pected to indicate “insufficient information” or other re- jection signals. • Information Integration , which evaluates whether LLMs can answer complex questions that require inte- grating information from multiple documents. For the in- stance in Figure 1, for the question “When were the Chat- GPT app for iOS and ChatGPT api launched?”, LLMs are expected to provide information of the launch dates for both the ChatGPT iOS app and ChatGPT API. The testbed for information integration contains instances that can only be answered using multiple documents.",

        "page_content": "• Counterfactual Robustness, which evaluates whether LLMs can identify risks of known factual errors in the retrieved documents when the LLMs are given warnings about potential risks in the retrieved information through instruction. The testbed for counterfactual robustness in- cludes instances that can be answered directly by the LLMs, but the external documents contain factual errors. Based on RGB, we conduct evaluation on 6 state-of- the-art large language models including ChatGPT (Ope- nAI 2022), ChatGLM-6B (THUDM 2023a), ChatGLM2- 6B (THUDM 2023b), Vicuna-7b (Chiang et al. 2023), Qwen-7B-Chat (QwenLM 2023), BELLE-7B (Yunjie Ji 2023). We found that even though RAG can improve the re- sponse accuracy of LLMs, they still suffer from the above- mentioned challenges significantly. Specifically, we found that even though LLMs demonstrate some level of noise ro- bustness, they tend to confuse similar information and fre- quently generate inaccurate answers when relevant informa- tion exists. For example, when faced with a question about the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature, if there are noisy docu- ments about the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature in external documents, LLMs may become confused and provide inac- curate answers. Besides, LLMs frequently fail to reject an- swering and generate incorrect answers when none of the external documents contain relevant information. Further- more, LLMs lack the ability to summarize from multiple documents, and therefore if multiple documents are needed to answer a question, LLMs often fail to provide accurate answer. Finally, we found that even when the LLMs contain the required knowledge and are given warnings about po- tential risks in the retrieved information through instruction, they still tend to trust and prioritize the retrieved information over their own existing knowledge. The experimental results mentioned above highlight the need for further resolution of important issues in the existing RAG method. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution and carefully design its usage. Generally speaking, the contributions of this paper are1: • We proposed to evaluate four capabilities for retrieval- augmented generation of LLMs and created the Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark in both En- glish and Chinese. To best of our knowledge, it is the first benchmark designed to assess these four capabilities for retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs. • We evaluated the existing LLMs using RGB and found the limitations of them in the four different abilities. • We analyzed the responses of LLMs in RGB and identi- fied their current shortcomings as well as suggested di- rections for improvement. Related work Retrieval-augmented models The knowledge stored in large language models is commonly out-of-date (He, Zhang, and Roth 2022) and they also sometimes generate hallu- cination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes, and Junczys- Dowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023) i.e., they may generate ir- relevant or factually incorrect contents. By using external knowledge as guidance, retrieval-augmented models can generate more accurate and reliable responses (Guu et al. 2020; Lewis et al. 2020; Borgeaud et al. 2022; Izacard et al. 2022; Shi et al. 2023; Ren et al. 2023).

Recently, with the development of large mod- els, a series of retrieval-enhanced tools and products have gained widespread attention, such as ChatGPT retrieval plu- gin, Langchain, New Bing, etc. However, in real-world sce- narios, the retrieved text inevitably contains noise. There- fore, in this paper we conducted a systematic evaluation and analysis of retrieval-augmented generation in LLMs. Evaluation of LLMs Evaluating LLMs has received sig- nificant attention due to their remarkable general capabil- ity (Chang et al. 2023). It enables us to gain a deeper under- standing of the specific abilities and limitations of LLMs, while also providing valuable guidance for future research. In the past, benchmarks such as GLUE (Wang et al. 2019b) and SuperCLUE (Wang et al. 2019a) primarily focused on evaluating NLP tasks, particularly in natural language un- derstanding. However, these evaluations often fail to fully capture the capabilities of LLMs. MMLU (Hendrycks et al. 2021) was then proposed to measure the knowledge acquired by language models when pre-training. Recently, with the development of LLMs, a series of general evaluation bench- marks have emerged, such as AGIEval (Zhong et al. 2023), C-Eval (Huang et al. 2023), AlpacaEval (Li et al. 2023b), OpenLLM Leaderboard (Edward Beeching 2023), etc. In addition to general abilities, there are also specific bench- marks that focus on evaluating the capabilities of models. For example, CValues (Xu et al. 2023a) focuses on the safety and responsibility of LLMs, M3Exam (Zhang et al. 2023) focuses on human exam and ToolBench (Qin et al. 2023) evaluates how well LLMs use external tools. Recently, Ad- lakha et al. (2023) evaluate the RAG of LLMs in exist QA dataset. Different from their work, we focus on 4 required abilities of RAG and create Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion Benchmark to evaluate the LLMs.",

        "page_content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark In this section, we first introduce the specific retrieval- augmented generation abilities we aim to evaluate. Next, we outline the process of constructing the RAG benchmark for evaluation. Lastly, we present the evaluation metrics. Required abilities of RAG External knowledge is the key to resolving the problems of LLMs such as hallucination and outdated knowledge, which can make LLMs generate more accurate and reliable responses through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, LLMs cannot always response as expected with RAG. For one thing, there are numerous irrelevant docu- ments and false information on the Internet. Incorporating these external documents into LLMs could have a detrimen- tal effect. For anthoer, LLMs suffer from the unreliable gen- eration challenge. The generation of LLMs is often unpre- dictable, and we cannot guarantee that they will utilize the useful information entailed in the external documents. Ad- ditionally, LLMs can easily be misled by incorrect infor- mation in the document. To this end, we build Retrieval- Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB) to evaluate the retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs, and we concern about 4 specific abilities: Noise Robustness is the robustness of LLMs in noisy documents. As retrievers are not perfect, the external knowl- edge they retrieve often contains a significant amount of noise, i.e., documents which are relevant to the question but do not contain any information about the answer. To effec- tively answer user questions, LLMs must be able to extract the necessary information from documents despite there are noisy documents. Negative Rejectionis a measure of whether LLMs can decline to answer a question when none of the contexts pro- vide useful information. In real-world situations, the search engine often fails to retrieve documents containing the an- swers. In these cases, it is important for the model to have the capability to reject recognition and avoid generating mis- leading content. Information Integration is a capacity to integrate an- swers from multiple documents. In many cases, the an- swer to a question may be contained in multiple documents. For example, for the question “Who are the champions of the U.S. Open 2022 men’s and women’s singles?”, the two champions may be mentioned in different documents. In or- der to provide better answers to complex questions, it is nec- essary for LLMs to have the ability to integrate information. Counterfactual Robustnessrefers to a capacity to han- dle errors in external knowledge. In the real world, there is an abundance of false information on the internet. Please",

        "page_content": "note that we only evaluate the situation that LLMs are given warnings about potential risks in the retrieved information through instruction. In real-world scenarios, it is not possible to obtain per- fect documents with all the necessary external knowledge. Therefore, evaluating these four abilities of the model be- comes essential in order to measure the RAG of LLMs. Data construction Inspired by previous benchmarks for LLMs, RGB utilizes a question-answering format for evaluation. We evaluate the LLMs by judging the retrieval-augmented responses of them to the questions. To simulate real-world scenarios, we con- struct question and answer data using actual news articles. Due to the abundance of knowledge contained within the LLMs there is a potential for bias when measuring the first three abilities. To mitigate this, the instances of RGB are constructed by latest news articles. Additionally, we retrieve external documents from Internet through search engines. Finally, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. The overall procedure of our data construction is illustrated in Figure 2. QA instances generation.We first collect latest news ar- ticles and use prompts to make ChatGPT generate events, questions, and answers for each articles. For example, as shown in the Figure 2, for a report about “The 2022 Nobel Prize”, ChatGPT will generate corresponding event, ques- tion and provide key information for answering it. By gen- erating events, the model is able to preliminarily filter out news articles that do not contain any events. After genera- tion, we manually check the answer and filter out data that is difficult to retrieve through search engines. Retrieve using search engine.For each query, we use Google’s API to fetch 10 relevant web pages and extract corresponding snippets of text from them. Simultaneously, we read these web pages and convert their textual content into text chunks with a maximum length of 300 tokens. Us- ing an existing dense retrieval model 2, we select the top-30 text chunks that match the query most effectively. These re- trieved text chunks, along with the snippets provided by the search API, will serve as our external documents. These doc- uments will be divided into positive documents and negative documents based on whether they contain the answer. Testbeds construction for each ability.We expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. To evaluate the noise robustness, we sample varying numbers of negative documents ac- cording to the desired ratio of noises. For negative rejec- tion, all the external documents are sampled from negative documents. For the information integration ability, we fur- ther construct data based on the above generated questions. This involves expanding or rewriting these questions so that their answers encompass multiple aspects. For example, the question “Who won the MVP of Super Bowl 2023?” can be rewrite as “Who won the MVPs of Super Bowl 2022 and 2023?”.

Please note that external documents may contain noisy or factually incorrect information. If the information in the document contains the correct answer, you will give an accurate answer. If the information in the document does not contain the answer, you will generate ’I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.‘ If there are inconsistencies with the facts in some of the documents, please generate the response 'There are factual errors in the provided documents.' and provide the correct answer.

Dif- ferent from the first three abilities, the data of counterfactual robustness is constructed solely based on the internal knowl- edge of the model. Based on the aforementioned generated questions mentioned above, we adopt ChatGPT to automat- ically generate its known knowledge. Specifically, we use prompts to allow the model to generate both questions and answers that are already known. For example, based on the question “Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Phys- iology and Medicine?”, the model will generate the known question “Who was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Lit- erature?” and answer “ Abdulrazak Gurnah”. We then man- ually verified the generated answers, and retrieve relevant documents as described above. In order to make documents contain factual errors, we manually modify the answers and replace the corresponding parts in the document. Finally, we collect totally 600 base questions in RGB, and 200 additional questions for the information integration ability and 200 additional questions for counterfactual ro- bustness ability. Half of the instances are in English, and the other half are in Chinese. Evaluation metrics The core of this benchmark is to evaluate whether LLMs can utilize the provided external documents to acquire knowl- edge and generate reasonable answers. We evaluate the re- sponses of LLMs in order to measure above-mentioned four abilities of them. Accuracy is used to measure noise robustness and infor- mation integration. We employ an exact matching approach where if the generated text contains an exact match to the answer, it is considered as a correct answer. Rejection rate is used to measure negative rejection. When only noisy documents are provided, LLMs should output the specific content – “I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.” (We use instructions to inform the model.). If the model gener- ates this content, it indicates a successful rejection. Error detection ratemeasures whether the model can detect the factual errors in the documents for counterfactual robustness. When the provided documents contain factual errors, the model should output the specific content – “There are factual errors in the provided documents.” (We use in-",

In such cases, it is typical for the question’s information to be initially presented at the start of the doc- ument and subsequently referred to using pronouns. In Ta- ble 2, the question information (“Qatar Open 2022”) is only mentioned once at the beginning and is far from where the answer text “Anett Kontaveit” appears. This situation may cause LLMs to depend on information from other docu- ments and create false impressions, i.e., hallucination. (2) Evidence uncertainty. Before highly anticipated events, like the release of new Apple products or the an- nouncement of the Oscars, there is often a significant amount of speculative information circulating on the inter- net. Although the relevant documents explicitly state that it is uncertain or speculative content, they can still impact on the retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs. In Table 2, when the noise ratio increases, the content of erroneous documents is all about some people’s predictions about the name of the headset (“Apple Reality Pro”). Even if there is a correct answer (“Vision Pro”) in the relevant documents, LLMs can still be misled by uncertain evidences. (3) Concept confusion.The concepts in external docu- ments may be similar to, but different from, the concepts in the question. This can cause confusion for LLMs and make LLMs generate incorrect answers. In Table 2, the model an- swer focuses on the concept “automotive revenue” in the document rather than “revenue” in the question. Based on the analysis above, we have identified certain limitations in LLMs regarding retrieval-augmented genera- tion. To effectively handle the vast amount of noise present on the internet, further detailed enhancements are required for the model such as long documents modeling and precise concept comprehension.",

In addi- tion to evaluating the rejection rate through exact matching (Rej in Table 3), we also utilize ChatGPT to determine if the responses from the LLMs contain any rejection informa- tion (Rej∗ in Table 3). We can see that: Negative Rejection poses a challenge for RAG in LLMs.The highest rejection rates for LLMs in English and Chinese were only 45% and 43.33%, respectively. This suggests that LLMs can be easily misled by noisy documents, leading to incorrect answers. In addition, through comparing Rej and Rej ∗, we found that LLMs fail to strictly follow instructions, and they often generate unpredictable responses, which make it hard to use them as state triggers (such as for recognizing rejection). We conduct case studies in Table 4. The first error is because of Evidence uncertainty. Although the document only mentions contact with “Adam McKay” and does not explicitly state that he is the director of the movie, the model still concludes that he holds this role. The first er- ror is because of Concept confusion. The information pro- vided in the answer pertains to “the 2018 Winter Olympics” instead of “the 2022 Olympics” mentioned in the question.

In future developments, it will be crucial for LLMs to enhance their ability to accu- rately match questions with the appropriate documents. Results on Information Integration testbed We evaluated the accuracy based on the different noise ratios in external documents, and the results are shown in Table 5. When comparing the model to Table 1, we observed that it has a weak information integration ability, which in turn affects its noise robustness. We can see that: (1) Information integration poses a challenge for RAG in LLMs.Even without noise, the highest accuracy of LLMs can only reach 60% and 67% for English and Chinese, respectively. After adding noise, the highest accuracy de- creases to 43% and 55%. These results suggest that LLMs struggle with integrating information effectively and are not well-suited for directly answering complex questions. (2) Complex questions are more challenging for RAG with noisy documents.Performance decline becomes sig- nificant when the noise ratio is 0.4, but for simple problems, a significant decline occurs only at a noise ratio of 0.8 at a significance level of 0.05. This indicates that complex prob- lems are more vulnerable to interference from noise. We speculate that this is because solving complex problems re- quires integrating information from multiple documents, and this information can be considered as noise to each other, making it harder for the model to extract relevant informa- tion from the documents.",

MisalignmentError Table 6: Error cases of information integration, the re- sponses are generated by ChatGLM2-6B. The blue and red texts represent the answers to two sub-questions. (1) Merging Error (28% of the total).The model some- times merges the answers of the two sub-questions, resulting in an error. It mistakenly uses the answer from one question to address both two questions. At this point, the model will disregard any documents related to one sub-question. For example, in Table 6, it incorrectly states that Group D is the World Cup group for both France and Germany, while in fact Germany is actually assigned to Group E. (2) Ignoring Error (28% of the total).Sometimes, the model may ignore one of the sub-questions and only answer the other. This error occurs when the model lacks a complete understanding of the problem and fails to recognize that it consists of multiple sub-problems. As a result, the model only considers relevant documents for one sub-problem in order to generate an answer, disregarding the question posed by another sub-problem. For example, in Table 6, the model only provides the answer for the MVP of Super Bowl 2022 and does not consider 2023. (3) Misalignment Error (6% of the total).Sometimes, the model incorrectly identifies the documents for one sub- question as the documents for another sub-question, leading to misaligned answers. For example, in Table 6, the third an- swer has two errors: an ignoring error and a misalignment er- ror. Firstly, the model only mentioned the Best Picture of the 2023 (95th) Academy Awards, completely disregarding the 2022 awards. Additionally, it incorrectly stated that “CODA” is the Best Picture of 2023 when it was actually awarded as the Best Picture in 2022. The errors mentioned above are primarily caused by the limited understanding of complex questions, which hinders the ability to effectively utilize information from different sub-problems. The key lies in improving the model’s rea- soning capability.

CR is the error cor- rection rate. thought approach to break down complex problems (Zhou et al. 2023a; Xu et al. 2023b; Drozdov et al. 2023). How- ever, these methods slow down the inference speed and can- not provide timely responses. Results on Counterfactual Robustness testbed In order to ensure that LLMs possess relevant knowledge, we assess their performance by directly asking them ques- tions. However, we found that most LLMs struggle to an- swer them correctly. To ensure a more reasonable evalua- tion, we only consider LLMs that have an accuracy rate of over 70% as this threshold is relatively high and encom- passes more LLMs. The results are shown in Table 7. We present the following metrics: accuracy without any docu- ments, accuracy with counterfactual documents, error de- tection rates, and error correction rates. We can see that It is hard for LLMs to identify and correct factual errors in the documents. This suggests that the model can be easily mis- led by documents containing incorrect facts. It is important to note that retrieval-augmented generation is not designed to automatically address factual errors within a given context, as this contradicts the underlying assump- tion that the model lacks knowledge and relies on retrieved documents for additional information. However, this issue is crucial in practical applications due to the abundance of fake news on the internet. Existing LLMs do not have a safeguard to handle inaccurate responses caused by misinformation. In fact, they heavily depend on the information they retrieve. Even when LLMs contain the internal knowledge about the questions, they often trust false information that is retrieved. This presents significant a challenge for the future develop- ment of RAG in LLMs.",

        "page_content": "Conclusion In this paper, we evaluated four abilities of retrieval- augmented generation in LLMs: noise robustness, nega- tive rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robustness. To conduct the evaluation, we built Retrieval- Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB). The instances of RGB are generated from latest news articles and the external documents obtained from search engines. The experimental results suggest that current LLMs have limitations in the 4 abilities. This indicates that there is still a significant amount of work needed to effectively apply RAG to LLMs. To en- sure accurate and reliable responses from LLMs, it is crucial to exercise caution and carefully design for RAG.",

        "page_content": "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nsatoshin@gmx.com\nwww.bitcoin.org\nAbstract.  A purely peer-to-peer version of  electronic cash would allow online  \npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a  \nfinancial institution.  Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main  \nbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.  \nWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. \nThe network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of  \nhash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing  \nthe proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of  \nevents witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.  As  \nlong as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to  \nattack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  The  \nnetwork itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are broadcast on a best effort  \nbasis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest  \nproof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.\n1. Introduction\nCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as  \ntrusted third parties to process electronic payments.  While the system works well enough for  \nmost  transactions,  it  still  suffers  from  the  inherent  weaknesses  of  the  trust  based  model.  \nCompletely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot  \navoid  mediating  disputes.   The  cost  of  mediation  increases  transaction  costs,  limiting  the  \nminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,  \nand there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-\nreversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must  \nbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.  \nA certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties  \ncan be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments  \nover a communications channel without a trusted party.\nWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,  \nallowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted  \nthird party.  Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers  \nfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.  In  \nthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed  \ntimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The  \nsystem  is  secure  as  long  as  honest  nodes  collectively  control  more  CPU  power  than  any  \ncooperating group of attacker nodes.\n1",

Each owner transfers the coin to the  \nnext by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner  \nand adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of  \nownership.\nThe problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend  \nthe coin.  A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every \ntransaction for double spending.  After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to  \nissue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.  \nThe  problem with  this solution  is that  the  fate of the entire  money system depends on the  \ncompany running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.\nWe need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier  \ntransactions.  For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care  \nabout later attempts to double-spend.  The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to  \nbe aware of all transactions.  In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and  \ndecided which arrived first.  To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be  \npublicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the  \norder in which they were received.  The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the \nmajority of nodes agreed it was the first received. \n3. Timestamp Server\nThe solution we propose begins with a timestamp server.  A timestamp server works by taking a  \nhash  of a  block  of  items  to  be  timestamped  and  widely  publishing  the  hash,  such  as  in  a  \nnewspaper or Usenet post [2-5].  The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the  \ntime, obviously, in order to get into the hash.  Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in  \nits hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.\n2\nBlock\nItem Item ...\nHash\nBlock\nItem Item ...\nHash\nTransaction\nOwner 1's\nPublic Key\nOwner 0's\nSignature\nHash\nTransaction\nOwner 2's\nPublic Key\nOwner 1's\nSignature\nHash\n Verify\nTransaction\nOwner 3's\nPublic Key\nOwner 2's\nSignature\nHash\n Verify\nOwner 2's\nPrivate Key\nOwner 1's\nPrivate Key\nSign  Sign  \nOwner 3's\nPrivate Key",

Proof-of-Work\nTo implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-\nof-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.  \nThe proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the  \nhash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number  \nof zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.\nFor our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the  \nblock until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.  Once the CPU  \neffort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed  \nwithout redoing the work.  As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block  \nwould include redoing all the blocks after it.\nThe proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision  \nmaking.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone  \nable  to  allocate  many  IPs.   Proof-of-work  is  essentially  one-CPU-one-vote.   The  majority  \ndecision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested  \nin it.  If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the  \nfastest and outpace any competing chains.  To modify a past block, an attacker would have to  \nredo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the  \nwork of the honest nodes.  We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up \ndiminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.\nTo compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, \nthe proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of  \nblocks per hour.  If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.\n5. Network\nThe steps to run the network are as follows:\n1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\n2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.  \n3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.\n4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\n5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.\n6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the  \nchain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.\nNodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on  \nextending it.  If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some  \nnodes may receive one or the other first.  In that case, they work on the first one they received,  \nbut save the other branch in case it becomes longer.  The tie will be broken when the next proof-\nof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other  \nbranch will then switch to the longer one.\n3\nBlock\nPrev Hash Nonce\nTx Tx ...\nBlock\nPrev Hash Nonce\nTx Tx ...",

        "page_content": "New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes.  As long as they reach  \nmany nodes, they will get into a block before long.  Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped  \nmessages.  If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and \nrealizes it missed one.\n6. Incentive\nBy convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned \nby the creator of the block.  This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides \na way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.  \nThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending  \nresources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\nThe incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is  \nless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of  \nthe  block  containing  the  transaction.   Once  a  predetermined  number  of  coins  have  entered  \ncirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation  \nfree.\nThe incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.  If a greedy attacker is able to  \nassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it  \nto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.  He ought to  \nfind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than  \neveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\n7. Reclaiming Disk Space\nOnce the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before  \nit can be discarded to save disk space.  To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,  \ntransactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. \nOld blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.  The interior hashes do  \nnot need to be stored.\nA block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes.  If we suppose blocks are  \ngenerated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.  With computer systems  \ntypically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of  \n1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in  \nmemory.\n4\nBlockBlock\nBlock Header (Block Hash)\nPrev Hash Nonce\nHash01\nHash0 Hash1 Hash2 Hash3\nHash23\nRoot Hash\nHash01\nHash2\nTx3\nHash23\nBlock Header (Block Hash)\nRoot Hash\nTransactions Hashed in a Merkle Tree After Pruning Tx0-2 from the Block\nPrev Hash Nonce\nHash3\nTx0 Tx1 Tx2 Tx3",

A user only needs to keep  \na copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying  \nnetwork nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch  \nlinking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.  He can't  check the transaction for  \nhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,  \nand blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\nAs such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more  \nvulnerable  if  the  network  is overpowered  by an  attacker.  While  network  nodes can  verify  \ntransactions for themselves, the  simplified  method  can be  fooled by an attacker's fabricated  \ntransactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.  One strategy to  \nprotect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid  \nblock, prompting  the  user's  software  to  download  the  full  block  and alerted  transactions to  \nconfirm the inconsistency.  Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to  \nrun their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.\n9. Combining and Splitting Value\nAlthough it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a  \nseparate transaction for every cent in a transfer.  To allow value to be split and combined,  \ntransactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.  Normally there will be either a single input  \nfrom a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two \noutputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.  \nIt should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those  \ntransactions depend on many more, is not a problem here.  There is never the need to extract a  \ncomplete standalone copy of a transaction's history.\n5\nTransaction\nIn\n...\nIn Out\n...\nHash01\nHash2 Hash3\nHash23\nBlock Header\nMerkle Root\nPrev Hash Nonce\nBlock Header\nMerkle Root\nPrev Hash Nonce\nBlock Header\nMerkle Root\nPrev Hash Nonce\nMerkle Branch for Tx3\nLongest Proof-of-Work Chain\nTx3",

The necessity to announce all transactions publicly  \nprecludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in  \nanother place: by keeping public keys anonymous.  The public can see that someone is sending  \nan amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.  This is  \nsimilar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of  \nindividual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.\nAs an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them  \nfrom being linked to a common owner.  Some  linking is still unavoidable with multi-input  \ntransactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.  The risk  \nis that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to  \nthe same owner.\n11. Calculations\nWe consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest \nchain.  Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such  \nas creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.  Nodes are  \nnot going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block  \ncontaining them.  An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back  \nmoney he recently spent.\nThe race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial  \nRandom Walk.  The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its  \nlead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the  \ngap by -1.\nThe probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's  \nRuin problem.  Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an \ninfinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven.  We can calculate the probability he ever  \nreaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:\np = probability an honest node finds the next block\nq = probability the attacker finds the next block\nqz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind\nqz={\n1 if p≤q\nq/ pz\nif pq}\n6\nIdentities Transactions Trusted\nThird Party Counterparty Public\nIdentities Transactions Public\nNew Privacy Model\nTraditional Privacy Model",

An attacker trying to generate an alternate chain cannot create value out of thin air or take money that never belonged to them. The probability of catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem.",

We assume the sender is an attacker  \nwho wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to  \nhimself after some time has passed.  The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the  \nsender hopes it will be too late.\nThe receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before  \nsigning.  This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on  \nit continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at  \nthat moment.  Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a  \nparallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction.\nThe recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and  z blocks have been  \nlinked  after  it.

Conclusion\nWe have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.  We started with  \nthe usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of  \nownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending.  To solve this, we  \nproposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions  \nthat quickly becomes computationally impractical  for  an attacker to change if honest nodes  \ncontrol a majority of CPU power.  The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.  Nodes  \nwork all at once with little coordination.  They do not need to be identified, since messages are  \nnot routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.  Nodes can  \nleave  and  rejoin  the  network  at  will,  accepting  the  proof-of-work  chain  as  proof  of  what  \nhappened while they were gone.  They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of  \nvalid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on  \nthem.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.\n8",

        "page_content": "Some organizations attempt to mitigate the inability to access domain data from\nother implementations, but these efforts have their own drawbacks. For example,\nshared databases are often used, though these frequently promote anti-patterns and\noften cannot scale sufficiently to accommodate all performance requirements. Data‐\nbases may provide read-only replicas; however, this can expose their inner data mod‐\nels unnecessarily. Batch processes can dump data to a file store to be read by other\nprocesses, but this approach can create issues around data consistency and multiple\nsources of truth. Lastly, all of these solutions result in a strong coupling between\nimplementations and further harden an architecture into direct point-to-point\nrelationships.\nIf you find that it is too hard to access data in your organization or\nthat your products are scope-creeping because all the data is loca‐\nted in a single implementation, you’re likely experiencing the\neffects of poor data communication structures. This problem will\nbe magnified as the organization grows, develops new products,\nand increasingly needs to access commonly used domain data.\nCommunication Structures in Traditional Computing\nAn organization’s communication structures greatly influence how engineering\nimplementations are created. This is true at the team level as well: the communication\nstructures of the team affect the solutions it builds for the specific business require‐\nments assigned to it. Let’s see how this works in practice.\nConsider the following scenario. A single team has a single service backed by a single\ndata store. They are happily providing their business function, and all is well in the\nworld. One day the team lead comes in with a new business requirement. It’s some‐\nwhat related to what the team is already doing and could possibly just be added on to\ntheir existing service. However, it’s also different enough that it could go into its own\nnew service.\nThe team is at a crossroads: do they implement the new business requirement in a\nnew service or simply add it to their existing service? Let’s take a look at their options\nin a bit more detail.\nOption 1: Make a New Service\nThe business requirement is different enough that it could make sense to put it into a\nnew service. But what about data? This new business function needs some of the old\ndata, but that data is currently locked up in the existing service. Additionally, the\nteam doesn’t really have a process for launching new, fully independent services. On\nthe other hand, the team is getting to be a bit big, and the company is growing\n10 | Chapter 1: Why Event-Driven Microservices",

If the team has to be divided in the future, having modular and independent\nsystems may make divvying up ownership much easier.\nThere are risks associated with this approach. The team must figure out a way to\nsource data from their original data store and copy it to their new data store. They\nneed to ensure that they don’t expose the inner workings and that the changes they\nmake to their data structures won’t affect any other teams copying their data. Addi‐\ntionally, the data being copied will always be somewhat stale, as they can only afford\nto copy production data in real time every 30 minutes so as not to saturate the data\nstore with queries. This connection will need to be monitored and maintained to\nensure that it is running correctly.\nThere is also a risk in spinning up and running a new service. They will need to man‐\nage two data stores, and two services, and establish logging, monitoring, testing,\ndeployment, and rollback processes for them. They must also take care to synchron‐\nize any data structure changes so as not to affect the dependent system.\nOption 2: Add It to the Existing Service\nThe other option is to create the new data structures and business logic within the\nexisting service. The required data is already in the data store, and the logging, moni‐\ntoring, testing, deployment, and rollback processes are already defined and in use.\nThe team is familiar with the system and can get right to work on implementing the\nlogic, and their monolithic patterns support this approach to service design.\nThere are also risks associated with this approach, though they are a bit more subtle.\nBoundaries within the implementation can blur as changes are made, especially since\nmodules are often bundled together in the same codebase. It is far too easy to quickly\nadd features by crossing those boundaries and directly couple across the module. \nThere is a major boon to moving quickly, but it comes at the cost of tight couplings,\nreduced cohesion, and a lack of modularity. Though teams can guard against this, it\nrequires excellent planning and strict adherence to boundaries, which often fall by\nthe wayside in the face of tight schedules, inexperience, and shifting service\nownership.\nPros and Cons of Each Option\nMost teams would choose the second option—adding the functionality to the existing\nsystem. There is nothing wrong with this choice; monolithic architectures are useful\nand powerful structures and can provide exceptional value to a business. The first\noption runs head first into the two problems associated with traditional computing:\n• Accessing another system’s data is difficult to do reliably, especially at scale and in\nreal time.\nCommunication Structures in Traditional Computing | 11",

Any\ndata encapsulated in another team’s data store is difficult to obtain, as it requires\ncrossing both implementation and business communication boundaries. This\nbecomes increasingly difficult to maintain and scale as data, connection count, and\nperformance requirements grow.\nThough copying the necessary data over is a worthy approach, it’s not foolproof. This\nmodel encourages many direct point-to-point couplings, which become problematic\nto maintain as an organization grows, business units and ownership change, and\nproducts mature and phase out. It creates a strict technical dependency the imple‐\nmentation communication structures of both teams (the team storing the data and\nthe team copying it), requiring them to work in synchronicity whenever a data\nchange is made. Special care must be taken to ensure that the internal data model of\nan implementation is not unduly exposed, lest other systems tightly couple to it. Scal‐\nability, performance, and system availability are often issues for both systems, as the\ndata replication query may place an unsustainable load on the source system. Failed\nsync processes may not be noticed until an emergency occurs. Tribal knowledge may\nresult in a team copying a copy of data, thinking that it’s the original source of truth.\nCopied data will always be somewhat stale by the time the query is complete and the\ndata is transferred. The larger the data set and the more complex its sourcing, the\nmore likely a copy will be out of sync with the original. This is problematic when sys‐\ntems expect each other to have perfect, up-to-date copies, particularly when commu‐\nnicating with one another about that data. For instance, a reporting service may\nreport different values than a billing service due to staleness. This can have serious\ndownstream consequences for service quality, reporting, analytics, and monetary-\nbased decision making.\nThe inability to correctly disseminate data throughout a company is not due to a fun‐\ndamental flaw in the concept. Quite the contrary: it’s due to a weak or nonexistent\ndata communication structure. In the preceding scenario, the team’s implementation\ncommunication structure is performing double duty as an extremely limited data\ncommunication structure.\nOne of the tenets of event-driven microservices is that core busi‐\nness data should be easy to obtain and usable by any service that\nrequires it. This replaces the ad hoc data communication structure\nin this scenario with a formalized data communication structure.\nFor the hypothetical team, this data communication structure\ncould eliminate most of the difficulties of obtaining data from\nother systems.\n12 | Chapter 1: Why Event-Driven Microservices",

It was quick, it was easy, and they have implemented\na number of new features since then. As the company has grown, the team has grown,\nand now it is time for it to be reorganized into two smaller, more focused teams.\nEach new team must now be assigned certain business functions from the previous\nservice. The business requirements of each team are neatly divided based on areas of\nthe business that need the most attention. Dividing the implementation communica‐\ntion structure, however, is not proving to be easy. Just as before, it seems that the\nteams both require large amounts of the same data to fulfill their requirements. New\nsets of questions arise:\n• Which team should own which data?\n• Where should the data reside?\n• What about data where both teams need to modify the values?\nThe team leads decide that it may be best to just share the service instead, and both of\nthem can work on different parts. This will require a lot more cross-team communi‐\ncation and synchronization of efforts, which may be a drag on productivity. And what\nabout in the future, if they double in size again? Or if the business requirements\nchange enough that they’re no longer able to fulfill everything with the same data\nstructure?\nConflicting Pressures\nThere are two conflicting pressures on the original team. It was influenced to keep all\nof its data local in one service to make adding new business functions quicker and\neasier, at the cost of expanding the implementation communication structure. Even‐\ntually the growth of the team necessitated splitting up the business communication\nstructure—a requirement followed by the reassignment of business requirements to\nthe new teams. The implementation communication structure, however, cannot sup‐\nport the reassignments in its current form and needs to be broken down into suitable\ncomponents. Neither approach is scalable, and both point to a need to do things dif‐\nferently. These problems all stem from the same root cause: a weak, ill-defined means\nof communicating data between implementation communication structures.\nEvent-Driven Communication Structures\nThe event-driven approach offers an alternative to the traditional behavior of imple‐\nmentation and data communication structures. Event-based communications are not\na drop-in replacement for request-response communications, but rather a completely\nEvent-Driven Communication Structures | 13",

        "page_content": "different way of communicating between services. An event-streaming data commu‐\nnication structure decouples the production and ownership of data from the access to\nit. Services no longer couple directly through a request-response API, but instead\nthrough event data defined within event streams (this process is covered more in\nChapter 3). Producers’ responsibilities are limited to producing well-defined data into\ntheir respective event streams.\nEvents Are the Basis of Communication\nAll shareable data is published to a set of event streams, forming a continuous, can‐\nonical narrative detailing everything that has happened in the organization. This\nbecomes the channel by which systems communicate with one another. Nearly any‐\nthing can be communicated as an event, from simple occurrences to complex, stateful\nrecords. Events are the data; they are not merely signals indicating data is ready else‐\nwhere or just a means of direct data transfer from one implementation to another.\nRather, they act both as data storage and as a means of asynchronous communication\nbetween services.\nEvent Streams Provide the Single Source of Truth\nEach event in a stream is a statement of fact, and together these statements form the\nsingle source of truth—the basis of communication for all systems within the organi‐\nzation. A communication structure is only as good as the veracity of its information,\nso it’s critical that the organization adopts the event stream narrative as a single\nsource of truth. If some teams choose instead to put conflicting data in other loca‐\ntions, the event stream’s function as the organization’s data communications back‐\nbone is significantly diminished.\nConsumers Perform Their Own Modeling and Querying\nThe event-based data communication structure differs from an overextended imple‐\nmentation communication structure in that it is incapable of providing any querying\nor data lookup functionality. All business and application logic must be encapsulated\nwithin the producer and consumer of the events.\nData access and modeling requirements are completely shifted to the consumer, with\nconsumers each obtaining their own copy of events from the source event streams.\nAny querying complexity is also shifted from the implementation communication\nstructure of the data owner to that of the consumer. The consumer remains fully\nresponsible for any mixing of data from multiple event streams, special query func‐\ntionality, or other business-specific implementation logic. Both producers and con‐\nsumers are otherwise relieved of their duty to provide querying mechanisms, data\ntransfer mechanisms, APIs (application programming interfaces), and cross-team\n14 | Chapter 1: Why Event-Driven Microservices",

The ownership of the event data\nmoves with the producing service, and organizational decisions can be made to\nreduce the amount of cross-team communication required to perform future work.\nThe nature of the microservice prevents spaghetti code and expansive monoliths\nfrom taking hold, provided that the overhead for creating new services and obtaining\nthe necessary data is minimal. Scaling concerns are now focused on individual event-\nprocessing services, which can scale their CPU, memory, disk, and instance count as\nrequired. The remaining scaling requirements are offloaded onto the data communi‐\ncation structure, which must ensure that it can handle the various loads of services\nconsuming from and producing to its event streams.\nTo do all of this, however, the team needs to ensure that the data is indeed present in\nthe data communication structure, and they must have the means for easily spinning\nup and managing a fleet of microservices. This requires an organization-wide adop‐\ntion of EDM architecture.\nSynchronous Microservices\nMicroservices can be implemented asynchronously using events (the approach this\nbook advocates) or synchronously, which is common in service-oriented architec‐\ntures. Synchronous microservices tend to be fulfilled using a request-response\napproach, where services communicate directly through APIs to fulfill business\nrequirements.\nDrawbacks of Synchronous Microservices\nThere are a number of issues with synchronous microservices that make them diffi‐\ncult to use at large scale. This is not to say that a company cannot succeed by using\nsynchronous microservices, as evidenced by the achievements of companies such as\nNetflix, Lyft, Uber, and Facebook. But many companies have also made fortunes\nusing archaic and horribly tangled spaghetti-code monoliths, so do not confuse the\nultimate success of a company with the quality of its underlying architecture. There\nare a number of books that describe how to implement synchronous microservices,\nso I recommend that you read those to get a better understanding of synchronous\napproaches.1\nFurthermore, note that neither point-to-point request-response microservices nor\nasynchronous event-driven microservices are strictly better than the other. Both have\ntheir place in an organization, as some tasks are far better suited to one over the\nSynchronous Microservices | 17",

        "page_content": "consumption of the message is handled on a per-queue basis. Applications that share\nconsumption from a queue will each receive only a subset of the records. This makes\nit impossible to correctly communicate state via events, since each consumer is\nunable to obtain a full copy of all events. Unlike the message broker, the event broker\nmaintains a single ledger of records and manages individual access via indices, so\neach independent consumer can access all required events. Additionally, a message\nbroker deletes events after acknowledgment, whereas an event broker retains them\nfor as long as the organization needs. The deletion of the event after consumption\nmakes a message broker insufficient for providing the indefinitely stored, globally\naccessible, replayable, single source of truth for all applications.\nEvent brokers enable an immutable, append-only log of facts that\npreserves the state of event ordering. The consumer can pick up\nand reprocess from anywhere in the log at any time. This pattern is\nessential for enabling event-driven microservices, but it is not\navailable with message brokers.\nKeep in mind that queues, as used in message brokers, still have a role in event-driven\nmicroservices. Queues provide useful access patterns that may be awkward to imple‐\nment with strictly partitioned event streams. The patterns introduced by message\nbroker systems are certainly valid patterns for EDM architectures, but they are not\nsufficient for the full scope of duties such architectures require. The remainder of the\nbook focuses not on any message broker architectures or application design, but\ninstead on the usage of event brokers in EDM architectures.\nConsuming from the Immutable Log\nThough not a definitive standard, commonly available event brokers use an append-\nonly immutable log. Events are appended at the end of the log and given an autoincre‐\nmenting index ID. Consumers of the data use a reference to the index ID to access\ndata. Events can then be consumed as either an event stream or a queue, depending\non the needs of the business and the available functionality of the event broker.\nConsuming as an event stream\nEach consumer is responsible for updating its own pointers to previously read indices\nwithin the event stream. This index, known as the offset, is the measurement of the\ncurrent event from the beginning of the event stream. Offsets permit multiple con‐\nsumers to consume and track their progress independently of one another, as shown\nin Figure 2-6.\n32 | Chapter 2: Event-Driven Microservice Fundamentals",

        "page_content": "Putting Microservices into Containers\nContainers, as recently popularized by Docker, isolate applications from one another.\nContainers leverage the existing host operating system via a shared kernel model.\nThis provides basic separation between containers, while the container itself isolates\nenvironment variables, libraries, and other dependencies. Containers provide most of\nthe benefits of a virtual machine (covered next) at a fraction of the cost, with fast\nstartup times and low resource overhead.\nContainers’ shared operating system approach does have some tradeoffs. Container‐\nized applications must be able to run on the host OS. If an application requires a spe‐\ncialized OS, then an independent host will need to be set up. Security is one of the\nmajor concerns, since containers share access to the host machine’s OS. A vulnerabil‐\nity in the kernel can put all the containers on that host at risk. With friendly work‐\nloads this is unlikely to be a problem, but current shared tenancy models in cloud\ncomputing are beginning to make it a bigger consideration.\nPutting Microservices into Virtual Machines\nVirtual machines (VMs) address some of the shortcomings of containers, though\ntheir adoption has been slower. Traditional VMs provide full isolation with a self-\ncontained OS and virtualized hardware specified for each instance. Although this\nalternative provides higher security than containers, it has historically been much\nmore expensive. Each VM has higher overhead costs compared to containers, with\nslower startup times and larger system footprints.\nEfforts are under way to make VMs cheaper and more efficient.\nCurrent initiatives include Google’s gVisor, Amazon’s Firecracker,\nand Kata Containers, to mention just a few. As these technologies\nimprove, VMs will become a much more competitive alternative to\ncontainers for your microservice needs. It is worth keeping an eye\non this domain should your needs be driven by security-first\nrequirements.\nManaging Containers and Virtual Machines\nContainers and VMs are managed through a variety of purpose-built software known\nas container management systems  (CMSes). These control container deployment,\nresource allocation, and integration with the underlying compute resources. Popular\nand commonly used CMSes include Kubernetes, Docker Engine , Mesos Marathon,\nAmazon ECS, and Nomad.\nMicroservices must be able to scale up and down depending on changing workloads,\nservice-level agreements (SLAs), and performance requirements. Vertical scaling\nmust be supported, in which compute resources such as CPU, memory, and disk are\nManaging Microservices at Scale | 35",

Horizontal scaling must also\nbe supported, with new instances added or removed.\nEach microservice should be deployed as a single unit. For many microservices, a sin‐\ngle executable is all that is needed to perform its business requirements, and it can be\ndeployed within a single container. Other microservices may be more complex, with\nmultiple containers and external data stores requiring coordination. This is where\nsomething like Kubernetes’s pod concept comes into play, allowing for multiple con‐\ntainers to be deployed and reverted as a single action. Kubernetes also allows for\nsingle-run operations; for example, database migrations can be run during the execu‐\ntion of the single deployable.\nVM management is supported by a number of implementations, but is currently\nmore limited than container management. Kubernetes and Docker Engine support\nGoogle’s gVisor and Kata Containers, while Amazon’s platform supports AWS Fire‐\ncracker. The lines between containers and VMs will continue to blur as development\ncontinues. Make sure that the CMS you select will handle the containers and VMs\nthat you require of it.\nThere are rich sets of resources available for Kubernetes, Docker,\nMesos, Amazon ECS , and Nomad. The information they provide\ngoes far beyond what I can present here. I encourage you to look\ninto these materials for more information.\nPaying the Microservice Tax\nThe microservice tax is the sum of costs, including financial, manpower, and opportu‐\nnity, associated with implementing the tools and components of a microservice archi‐\ntecture. This includes the cost of managing, deploying, and operating the event\nbroker, CMS, deployment pipelines, monitoring solutions, and logging services.\nThese expenses are unavoidable and are paid either centrally by the organization or\nindependently by each team implementing microservices. The former results in a\nscalable, simplified, and unified framework for developing microservices, while the\nlatter results in excessive overhead, duplicate solutions, fragmented tooling, and\nunsustainable growth.\nPaying the microservice tax is not a trivial matter, and it is one of the largest impedi‐\nments to getting started with EDM. Small organizations would likely do best to stick\nwith an architecture that better suits their business needs, such as a modular mono‐\nlith. Larger organizations need to account for the total costs of both the\nimplementation and maintenance of a microservice platform and determine if the\nlong-term roadmap of their business can accommodate the predicted work efforts.\n36 | Chapter 2: Event-Driven Microservice Fundamentals",

Similarly, you must also be care‐\nful when modifying the triggering logic. It is far more common to change the data\ndefinition than the triggering mechanism, as altering the latter often breaks the\nmeaning of the original event definition.\nUsing Explicit Schemas as Contracts\nThe best way to enforce data contracts and provide consistency is to define a schema\nfor each event. The producer defines an explicit schema detailing the data definition\nand the triggering logic, with all events of the same type adhering to this format. In\ndoing so, the producer provides a mechanism for communicating its event format to\nall prospective consumers. The consumers, in turn, can confidently build their micro‐\nservice business logic against the schematized data.\nAny implementation of event-based communication between a\nproducer and consumer that lacks an explicit predefined schema\nwill inevitably end up relying on an implicit schema. Implicit data\ncontracts are brittle and susceptible to uncontrolled change, which\ncan cause much undue hardship to downstream consumers.\nA consumer must be able to extract the data necessary for its business processes, and\nit cannot do that without having a set of expectations about what data should be\navailable. Consumers must often rely on tribal knowledge and interteam communica‐\ntion to resolve data issues, a process that is not scalable as the number of event\nstreams and teams increases. There is also substantial risk in requiring each con‐\nsumer to independently interpret the data, as a consumer may interpret it differently\nthan its peers, which leads to inconsistent views of the single source of truth.\nIt may be tempting to build a common library that interprets any\ngiven event for all services, but this creates problems with multiple\nlanguage formats, event evolutions, and independent release cycles.\nDuplicating efforts across services to ensure a consistent view of\nimplicitly defined data is nontrivial and best avoided completely.\nProducers are also at a disadvantage with implicit schemas. Even with the best of\nintentions, a producer may not notice (or perhaps their unit tests don’t reveal) that\nthey have altered their event data definition. Without an explicit check of their serv‐\nice’s event format, this situation may go unnoticed until it causes downstream con‐\nsumers to fail. Explicit schemas give security and stability to both consumers and\nproducers.\n40 | Chapter 3: Communication and Data Contracts",

As mentioned, I recommend instead choosing a\nstrongly defined, explicit schema format that supports controlled\nschema evolution, such as Apache Avro or Protobuf. I do not rec‐\nommend JSON, as it does not provide full-compatibility schema\nevolution.\nDesigning Events\nThere are a number of best practices to follow when you are creating event defini‐\ntions, as well as several anti-patterns to avoid. Keep in mind that as the number of\narchitectures powered by event-driven microservices expands, so does the number of\nevent definitions. Well-designed events will minimize the otherwise repetitive pain\npoints for both consumers and producers. With that being said, none of the following\nare hard-and-fast rules. Y ou can break them as you see fit, though I recommend that\nyou think very carefully about the full scope of implications and the tradeoffs for\nyour problem space before proceeding.\nTell the Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth\nA good event definition is not simply a message indicating that something happened,\nbut rather the complete description of everything that happened during that event. In\nbusiness terms, this is the resultant data that is produced when input data is ingested\nand the business logic is applied. This output event must be treated as the single\nsource of truth and must be recorded as an immutable fact for consumption by\ndownstream consumers. It is the full and total authority on what actually occurred,\nand consumers should not need to consult any other source of data to know that such\nan event took place.\nUse a Singular Event Definition per Stream\nAn event stream should contain events representing a single logical event. It is not\nadvisable to mix different types of events within an event stream, because doing so\ncan muddle the definitions of what the event is and what the stream represents. It is\ndifficult to validate the schemas being produced, as new schemas may be added\ndynamically in such a scenario. Though there are special circumstances where you\nmay wish to ignore this principle, the vast majority of event streams produced and\nconsumed within your architectural workflow should each have a strict, single\ndefinition.\n46 | Chapter 3: Communication and Data Contracts",

This lets you rely on the code generators,\nlanguage type checking (if supported), and serialization unit tests to check the\nboundaries of your data. It sounds simple, but there are many cases where ambiguity\ncan creep in when you don’t use the proper types. Here are a few easily avoidable real-\nworld examples:\nUsing string to store a numeric value\nThis requires the consumer to parse and convert the string to a numeric value\nand often comes up with GPS coordinates. This is error prone and subject to fail‐\nures, especially when a null value or an empty string is sent.\nUsing integer as a boolean\nWhile 0 and 1 can be used to denote false and true, respectively, what does 2\nmean? How about -1?\nUsing string as an enum\nThis is problematic for producers, as they must ensure that their published values\nmatch an accepted pseudo-enum list. Typos and incorrect values will inevitably\nbe introduced. A consumer interested in this field will need to know the range of\npossible values, and this will require talking to the producing team, unless it’s\nspecified in the comments of the schema. In either case, this is an implicit defini‐\ntion, since the producers are not guarded against any changes to the range of val‐\nues in the string. This whole approach is simply bad practice.\nEnums are often avoided because producers fear creating a new enum token that isn’t\npresent in the consumer’s schema. However, the consumer has a responsibility to\nconsider enum tokens that it does not recognize, and determine if it should process\nthem using a default value or simply throw a fatal exception and halt processing until\nsomeone can work out what needs to be done. Both Protobuf and Avro have elegant\nways of handling unknown enum tokens and should be used if either is selected for\nyour event format.\nKeep Events Single-Purpose\nOne common anti-pattern is adding a type field to an event definition, where differ‐\nent type values indicate specific subfeatures of the event. This is generally done for\ndata that is “similar yet different” and is often a result of the implementer incorrectly\nidentifying the events as single-purpose. Though it may seem like a time-saving\nmeasure or a simplification of a data access pattern, overloading events with type\nparameters is rarely a good idea.\nThere are several problems with this approach. Each type parameter value usually\nhas a fundamentally different business meaning, even if its technical representation is\nDesigning Events | 47",

Some of these types may require\nthe addition of new parameters to track type-specific information, whereas other\ntypes require separate parameters. Eventually you could have a situation where there\nare several very distinct events all inhabiting the same event schema, making it diffi‐\ncult to reason about what the event truly represents.\nThis complexity affects not only the developers who must maintain and populate\nthese events, but also the data’s consumers, who need to have a consistent under‐\nstanding about what data is published and why. If the data contract changes, they\nexpect to be able to isolate themselves from those changes. Adding extra field types\nrequires them to filter for only data that they care about. There is a risk that the con‐\nsumer will fail to fully understand the various meanings of the types, leading to\nincorrect consumption and logically wrong code. For each consumer, additional pro‐\ncessing must also be done to discard events that aren’t relevant to that consumer.\nIt is very important to note that adding type fields does not reduce\nor eliminate the underlying complexity inherent in the data being\nproduced. In fact, this complexity is merely shifted from multiple\ndistinct event streams with distinct schemas to a union of all the\nschemas merged into one event stream. It could be argued that this\nactually increases the complexity. Future evolution of the schema\nbecomes more difficult, as does maintaining the code that produces\nthe events.\nRemember the principles of the data contract definition. Events should be related to a\nsingle business action, not a generic event that records large assortments of data. If it\nseems like you need a generic event with various type parameters, that’s usually a tell-\ntale sign that your problem space and bounded context is not well defined.\nExample: Overloading event definitions\nImagine a simple website where a user can read a book or watch a movie. When the\nuser first engages the website, say by opening the book or starting the movie, a back‐\nend service publishes an event of this engagement, named ProductEngagement, into\nan event stream. The data structure of this cautionary tale event may look something\nlike this:\nTypeEnum: Book, Movie\nActionEnum: Click\nProductEngagement {\n  productId: Long,\n  productType: TypeEnum,\n  actionType: ActionEnum\n}\n48 | Chapter 3: Communication and Data Contracts",

This can actually increase complexity and make future evolution of the schema more difficult. Events should be related to a single business action, not a generic event that records large amounts of data. Overloading event definitions can lead to poor design. An example of this is a ProductEngagement event with type parameters for book and movie, which may indicate a poorly defined problem space and bounded context.",

        "page_content": "Minimize the Size of Events\nEvents work well when they’re small, well defined, and easily processed. Large events\ncan and do happen, though. Generally these larger events represent a lot of contextual\ninformation. Perhaps they comprise many data points that are related to the given\nevent, and are simply a very large measurement of something that occurred.\nThere are several considerations when you’re looking at a design that produces a very\nlarge event. Make sure that the data is directly related and relevant to the event. Addi‐\ntional data may have been added to an event “just in case, ” but it may not be of any\nreal use to the downstream consumers. If you find that all the event data is indeed\ndirectly related, take a step back and look at your problem space. Does your microser‐\nvice require access to the data? Y ou may want to evaluate the bounded context to see\nif the service is performing a reasonable amount of work. Perhaps the service could\nbe reduced in scope with additional functionality split off into its own service.\nThis scenario is not always avoidable, though—some event processors produce very\nlarge output files (perhaps a large image) that are much too big to fit into a single\nmessage of an event stream. In these scenarios you can use a pointer to the actual\ndata, but do this sparingly. This approach adds risk in the form of multiple sources of\ntruth and payload mutability, as an immutable ledger cannot ensure the preservation\nof data outside of its system.\nInvolve Prospective Consumers in the Event Design\nWhen designing a new event, it is important to involve any anticipated consumers of\nthis data. Consumers will understand their own needs and anticipated business func‐\ntions better than the producers and may help in clarifying requirements. Consumers\nwill also get a better understanding of the data coming their way. A joint meeting or\ndiscussion can shake out any issues around the data contract between the two\nsystems.\nAvoid Events as Semaphores or Signals\nAvoid using events as a semaphore or a signal. These events simply indicate that\nsomething has occurred without being the single source of truth for the results.\nConsider a very simple example where a system outputs an event indicating that\nwork has been completed for an arbitrary job. Although the event itself indicates the\nwork is done, the actual result of the work is not included in the event. This means\nthat to consume this event properly, you must find where the completed work\nactually resides. Once there are two sources of truth for a piece of data, consistency\nproblems arise.\nDesigning Events | 51",

        "page_content": "Basic logging in Kubernetes behaves much like logging in Docker. There is a kubectl logs command that will show you all the information written to stdout and stderr for a given container in a pod. If a pod has only one container, there is no need to specify it explicitly, however when a pod has several containers we need to add -c container to the end of the command. As with Docker, we can opt to follow logs, to reduce the number of recent lines with --tail and we can filter them by date. Unlike Docker, Kubernetes enables us to check the logs of a container that crashed using the --previous option. The ability to keep the logs of a previous container is available as long as the pod it was run in remains available. When a pod is removed, so are its logs. Log rotation is performed by Kubernetes. The default values are daily rotation or 10 MB to avoid log files taking up all the available disk space. Up to five rotations are kept for historical evidence. Remember that only the last rotation is displayed with kubectl logs; if you want to access an earlier one, you must do so manually. Per our example with the Hello Minikube service, we can use kubectl logs hello-minikube- 2433534028-ouxw8 to view the access log containing our curl request. All information so far concerns per-node log files. There are no cluster-level logging capabilities built into Kubernetes, but there are some common methods that can be implemented for this purpose. In this approach, a logging agent is run on every node, preferably through a DeamonSet replica. A popular choice in this space is fluentd. It can be configured with various backends among which are Google Cloud Platform and Elasticsearch. Fluentd even goes as far as to provide a ready to use DaemonSet YAML on GitHub. All that needs to be done is edit its configuration to point at our logging backend. There are several use cases for this approach. The general idea is that a dedicated logging component in each pod either writes logs to its stdout and stderr or delivers the logs directly to a logging backend. With such a sidecar approach, we can aggregate all logs from different containers in a pod to a single stream that can be accessed with kubectl logs or we can split logs of one application into different logical streams. For example, Webservers’ access.log and error.log can each be streamed by a dedicated container to its stdout, so we can check them separately with kubectl logs $podname -c access-log and kubectl logs $podname -c error-log. If the application running in a pod can already communicate with a logging backend, it is possible to skip the Kubernetes logging options altogether. While direct logging may offer some performance advantages and provide slightly better security (all data stored in just one place), it also prevents us from using kubectl logs. In most cases, this approach is discouraged.

This idea of LMs as repositories of knowledge emerged shortly after the introduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more firmly established with the introduction of ever larger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most recent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture enough knowledge to rival human performance across a wide variety of question answering bench- marks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using LLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen- tal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer questions about events that have happened after they were trained. Second, even the largest models struggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely mentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution to these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question then essentially involves retrieving relevant pas- sages from a corpus and feeding these passages, along with the original question, to the LM. While initial approaches relied on specialised LMs for retrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel- wal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work has suggested that simply adding retrieved docu- ments to the input of a standard LM can also work well (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval- augmented strategies in combination with LLMs that are only available through APIs. While the usefulness of retrieval-augmented strategies is clear, their implementation requires a significant amount of tuning, as the overall per- formance will be affected by the retrieval model, the considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for- mulation, among others. Automated evaluation of retrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In practice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms of the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea- suring perplexity on some reference corpus. How- ever, such evaluations are not always predictive of downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c). Moreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM probabilities, which are not accessible for some closed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques- tion answering is another common evaluation task, but usually only datasets with short extractive an- swers are considered, which may not be represen- tative of how the system will be used. To address these issues, in this paper we present RAGA S1, a framework for the automated assess- 1RAGA S is available at https://github.com/ explodinggradients/ragas. arXiv:2309.15217v1 [cs.CL] 26 Sep 2023",

We focus on settings where reference answers may not be available, and where we want to estimate different proxies for correctness, in addition to the usefulness of the retrieved passages. The RAGA S framework provides an integration with both llama- index and Langchain, the most widely used frame- works for building RAG solutions, thus enabling developers to easily integrate RAGA S into their standard workflow. 2 Related Work Estimating faithfulness using LLMsThe prob- lem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated responses has been extensively studied (Ji et al., 2023). Several authors have suggested the idea of predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt- ing strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy- ses, however, suggest that existing models struggle with detecting hallucination when using standard prompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and Mitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking the generated responses to facts from an external knowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not always possible. Yet another strategy is to inspect the probabili- ties assigned to individual tokens, where we would expect the model to be less confident in halluci- nated answers than in factual ones. For instance, BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality by looking at the conditional probability of the gen- erated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022) use a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob- servation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba- bilities when answering multiple-choice questions, they essentially convert the problem of validating model generated answers into a multiple-choice question which asks whether the answer is true or false. Rather than looking at the output probabil- ities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train a supervised classifier on the weights from one of the hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a given statement is true or not. While the approach performs well, the need to access the hidden states of the model makes it unsuitable for systems that access LLMs through an API. For models that do not provide access to token probabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, differ- ent methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sam- pling multiple answers. Their core idea is that factual answers are more stable: when an answer is factual, we can expect that different samples will tend to be semantically similar, whereas this is less likely to be the case for hallucinated answers. Automated evaluation of text generation systems LLMs have also been leveraged to automatically evaluate other aspects of generated text fragments, beyond factuality. For instance, GPTScore (Fu et al., 2023) uses a prompt that specifies the consid- ered aspect (e.g. fluency) and then scores passages based on the average probability of the generated tokens, according to a given autoregressive LM. This idea of using prompts was previously also considered by Yuan et al. (2021), although they used a smaller fine-tuned LM (i.e. BART) and did not observe a clear benefit from using prompts. An- other approach directly asks ChatGPT to evaluate a particular aspect of the given answer by provid- ing a score between 0 and 100, or by providing a rating on a 5-star scale (Wang et al., 2023a). Re- markably, strong results can be obtained in this way, although it comes with the limitation of being sensitive to the design of the prompt. Rather than scoring individual answers, some authors have also focused on using an LLM to select the best answer among a number of candidates (Wang et al., 2023b), typically to compare the performance of different LLMs. However, care is needed with this approach, as the order in which the answers is presented can influence the result (Wang et al., 2023b). In terms of how ground truth answers or, more generally, generations, have been typically used in the literature, most approaches have relied on the availability of one or more reference answers. For instance, BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) use contex- tualised embeddings, produced by a pre-trained BERT model, to compare the similarity between the generated answer and the reference answers. BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) similarly uses refer- ence answers to compute aspects such as precision (estimated as the probability of generating the gen- erated answer given the reference) and recall (esti- mated as the probability of generating the reference given the generated answer).",

We focus in particular three quality\naspects, which we argue are of central importance.\nFirst, Faithfulness refers to the idea that the an-\nswer should be grounded in the given context. This\nis important to avoid hallucinations, and to ensure\nthat the retrieved context can act as a justification\nfor the generated answer. Indeed, RAG systems are\noften used in applications where the factual con-\nsistency of the generated text w.r.t. the grounded\nsources is highly important, e.g. in domains such as\nlaw, where information is constantly evolving. Sec-\nond, Answer Relevancerefers to the idea that the\ngenerated answer should address the actual ques-\ntion that was provided. Finally,Context Relevance\nrefers to the idea that the retrieved context should\nbe focused, containing as little irrelevant informa-\ntion as possible. This is important given the cost\nassociated with feeding long context passages to\nLLMs. Moreover, when context passages are too\nlong, LLMs are often less effective in exploiting\nthat context, especially for information that is pro-\nvided in the middle of the context passage (Liu\net al., 2023).\nWe now explain how these three quality aspects\ncan be measured in a fully automated way, by\nprompting an LLM. In our implementation and\nexperiments, all prompts are evaluated using the\ngpt-3.5-turbo-16k model, which is available\nthrough the OpenAI API2.\nFaithfulness We say that the answer as(q) is\nfaithful to the context c(q) if the claims that are\nmade in the answer can be inferred from the con-\ntext. To estimate faithfulness, we first use an LLM\nto extract a set of statements, S(as(q)). The aim\nof this step is to decompose longer sentences into\nshorter and more focused assertions. We use the\nfollowing prompt for this step3:\nGiven a question and answer, create one\nor more statements from each sentence\nin the given answer.\nquestion: [question]\nanswer: [answer]\nwhere [question] and [answer] refer to the\ngiven question and answer. For each statement si\n2https://platform.openai.com\n3To help clarify the task, we include a demonstration as\npart of the prompt. This demonstration is not explicitly shown\nin the listing of the prompts throughout this paper.\nin S, the LLM determines ifsi can be inferred from\nc(q) using a verification function v(si, c(q)). This\nverification step is carried out using the following\nprompt:\nConsider the given context and following\nstatements, then determine whether they\nare supported by the information present\nin the context. Provide a brief explana-\ntion for each statement before arriving\nat the verdict (Yes/No). Provide a final\nverdict for each statement in order at the\nend in the given format. Do not deviate\nfrom the specified format.\nstatement: [statement 1]\n...\nstatement: [statement n]\nThe final faithfulness score, F, is then computed\nas F = |V |\n|S| , where |V | is the number of statements\nthat were supported according to the LLM and |S|\nis the total number of statements.\nAnswer relevance We say that the answer as(q)\nis relevant if it directly addresses the question in\nan appropriate way. In particular, our assessment\nof answer relevance does not take into account fac-\ntuality, but penalises cases where the answer is\nincomplete or where it contains redundant informa-\ntion. To estimate answer relevance, for the given\nanswer as(q), we prompt the LLM to generate n\npotential questions qi based on as(q), as follows:\nGenerate a question for the given answer.\nanswer: [answer]\nWe then obtain embeddings for all questions us-\ning the text-embedding-ada-002 model, avail-\nable from the OpenAI API. For each qi, we cal-\nculate the similarity sim(q, qi) with the original\nquestion q, as the cosine between the correspond-\ning embeddings. The answer relevance score, AR,\nfor question q is then computed as:\nAR = 1\nn\nnX\ni=1\nsim(q, qi) (1)\nThis metric evaluates how closely the generated\nanswer aligns with the initial question or instruc-\ntion.\nContext relevance The context c(q) is consid-\nered relevant to the extent that it exclusively con-\ntains information that is needed to answer the ques-\ntion. In particular, this metric aims to penalise the",

To estimate context relevance, given a question q and its con- text c(q), the LLM extracts a subset of sentences, Sext, from c(q) that are crucial to answer q, using the following prompt: Please extract relevant sentences from the provided context that can potentially help answer the following question. If no relevant sentences are found, or if you believe the question cannot be answered from the given context, return the phrase \"Insufficient Information\". While extract- ing candidate sentences you’re not al- lowed to make any changes to sentences from given context. The context relevance score is then computed as: CR = number of extracted sentences total number of sentences in c(q) (2) 4 The WikiEval Dataset To evaluate the proposed framework, we ideally need examples of question-context-answer triples which are annotated with human judgments. We can then verify to what extent our metrics agree with human assessments of faithfulness, answer relevance and context relevance. Since we are not aware of any publicly available datasets that could be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset, which we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov- ering events that have happened since the start of 20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages, we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that can be answered based on the introductory section of the page, using the following prompt: Your task is to formulate a question from given context satisfying the rules given below: 1. The question should be fully answered from the given context. 2. The question should be framed from a part that contains non-trivial informa- tion. 3. The answer should not contain any 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/ explodinggradients/WikiEval 5That is, beyond the reported training cutoff of the model we used in our experiments. links. 4. The question should be of moderate difficulty. 5. The question must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans. 6. Do not use phrases that ’provided con- text’, etc in the question context: We also used ChatGPT to answer the generated question, when given the corresponding introduc- tory section as context, using the following prompt: Answer the question using the informa- tion from the given context. question: [question] context: [context] All questions were annotated along the three con- sidered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both annotators were fluent in English and were given clear instructions about the meaning of the three considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements were resolved after a discussion between the anno- tators. Faithfulness To obtain human judgements about faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the question without access to any additional context. We then asked the annotators to judge which of the two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard one or the one generated without context), given the question and corresponding Wikipedia page. Answer relevance We first used ChatGPT to obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel- evance, using the following prompt: Answer the given question in an incom- plete manner. question: [question] We then asked human annotators to compare this answer, and indicate which of the two answers had the highest answer relevance.",

For the few pages with-\nout any back-links, we instead used ChatGPT to\ncomplete the given context.\n5 Experiments\nTable 1 analyses the agreement between the met-\nrics proposed in Section 3 and the human assess-\nments from the proposed WikiEval dataset. Each\nWikiEval instance requires the model to compare\ntwo answers or two context fragments. We count\nhow often the answer/context preferred by the\nmodel (i.e. with highest estimated faithfulness, an-\nswer relevance, or context relevance) coincides\nwith the answer/context preferred by the human\nannotators. We report the results in terms of ac-\ncuracy (i.e. the fraction of instances on which the\nmodel agrees with the annotators).\nTo put the results in context, we compare our\nproposed metrics (shown asRAGAs in Table 1) with\ntwo baseline methods. For the first method, shown\nas GPT Score, we ask ChatGPT to assign a score\nbetween 0 and 10 for the three quality dimensions.\nTo this end, we use a prompt that describes the\nmeaning of the quality metric and then asks to\nscore the given answer/context in line with that\ndefinition. For instance, for evaluating faithfulness,\nwe used the following prompt:\nFaithfulness measures the information\nconsistency of the answer against the\ngiven context. Any claims that are made\nin the answer that cannot be deduced\nfrom context should be penalized.\nGiven an answer and context, assign a\nscore for faithfulness in the range 0-10.\ncontext: [context]\nanswer: [answer]\nTies, where the same score is assigned by the LLM\nto both answer candidates, were broken randomly.\nThe second baseline, shown as GPT Ranking, in-\nstead asks ChatGPT to select the preferred answer/-\ncontext. In this case, the prompt again includes\na definition of the considered quality metric. For\ninstance, for evaluating answer relevance, we used\nthe following prompt:\nAnswer Relevancy measures the degree\nto which a response directly addresses\nand is appropriate for a given question.\nIt penalizes the present of redundant in-\nformation or incomplete answers given a\nquestion. Given an question and answer,\nrank each answer based on Answer Rele-\nvancy.\nquestion: [question]\nanswer 1: [answer 1]\nanswer 2: [answer 2]\nThe results in Table 1 show that our proposed\nmetrics are much closer aligned with the human\njudgements than the predictions from the two base-\nlines. For faithfulness, the RAGAs prediction are\nin general highly accurate. For answer relevance,\nthe agreement is lower, but this is largely due to the\nfact that the differences between the two candidate\nanswers are often very subtle. We found context\nrelevance to be the hardest quality dimension to\nevaluate. In particular, we observed that ChatGPT\noften struggles with the task of selecting the sen-\ntences from the context that are crucial, especially\nfor longer contexts.\n6 Conclusions\nWe have highlighted the need for automated\nreference-free evaluation of RAG systems. In par-\nticular, we have argued the need for an evaluation\nframework that can assess faithfulness (i.e. is the\nanswer grounded in the retrieved context), answer\nrelevance (i.e. does the answer address the ques-\ntion) and context relevance (i.e. is the retrieved\ncontext sufficiently focused). To support the devel-\nopment of such a framework, we have introduced\nWikiEval, a dataset which human judgements of\nthese three different aspects. Finally, we have also\ndescribed RAGAs, our implementation of the three\nconsidered quality aspects. This framework is easy\nto use and can provide deverlopers of RAG sys-\ntems with valuable insights, even in the absence\nof any ground truth.

However, existing research lacks rigorous\nevaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation\non different large language models, which make it challeng-\ning to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities\nof RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systemati-\ncally investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Gener-\nation on large language models. We analyze the performance\nof different large language models in 4 fundamental abili-\nties required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative\nrejection, information integration, and counterfactual robust-\nness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in\nboth English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within\nthe benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the afore-\nmentioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case.\nThen we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diag-\nnose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG.\nEvaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree\nof noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of\nnegative rejection, information integration, and dealing with\nfalse information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes\nindicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to ef-\nfectively apply RAG to LLMs.\nIntroduction\nRecently, there have been impressive advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) and\nChatGLM (THUDM 2023a). Although these models have\nshown remarkable general abilities (Bang et al. 2023; Guo\net al. 2023), they still suffer severely from challenges includ-\ning factual hallucination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes,\nand Junczys-Dowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023), knowledge out-\ndating (He, Zhang, and Roth 2022), and the lack of domain-\nspecific expertise (Li et al. 2023c; Shen et al. 2023).\nIncorporating external knowledge via information re-\ntrieval, i.e., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), has\nbeen regarded as a promising way to resolve the above chal-\nlenges.

With the help of external knowl-\nedge, LLMs can generate more accurate and reliable re-\nsponses. The most common method is to use a search engine\nas a retriever such as New Bing. Due to the vast amount of\ninformation available on the Internet, using a search engine\ncan provide more real-time information.\nHowever, Retrieval-Augmented Generation brings not\nonly positive effects to LLMs (Liu, Zhang, and Liang 2023;\nMaynez et al. 2020). On one hand, there is a significant\namount of noise information even fake news in the content\navailable on the Internet, which poses challenges for search\nengines in accurately retrieving desirable knowledge. On the\nother hand, LLMs suffer from unreliable generation chal-\nlenge. LLMs can be misled by incorrect information con-\ntained in the context (Bian et al. 2023) and also suffer from\nhallucination during the generation (Adlakha et al. 2023),\nresulting in generating content that goes beyond external in-\narXiv:2309.01431v2  [cs.CL]  20 Dec 2023",

However, existing research lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on different large language models, which make it challeng- ing to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systemati- cally investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Gener- ation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different large language models in 4 fundamental abili- ties required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robust- ness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the afore- mentioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diag- nose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to ef- fectively apply RAG to LLMs. Introduction Recently, there have been impressive advancements in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) and ChatGLM (THUDM 2023a). Although these models have shown remarkable general abilities (Bang et al. 2023; Guo et al. 2023), they still suffer severely from challenges includ- ing factual hallucination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes, and Junczys-Dowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023), knowledge out- dating (He, Zhang, and Roth 2022), and the lack of domain- specific expertise (Li et al. 2023c; Shen et al. 2023). Incorporating external knowledge via information re- trieval, i.e., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), has been regarded as a promising way to resolve the above chal- lenges.

Question Counterfactual external documents Retrieval Augmented Generation Retrieval Augmented Generation Figure 1: Illustration of 4 kinds of abilities required for retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs. 2022; Izacard et al. 2022). With the help of external knowl- edge, LLMs can generate more accurate and reliable re- sponses. The most common method is to use a search engine as a retriever such as New Bing. Due to the vast amount of information available on the Internet, using a search engine can provide more real-time information. However, Retrieval-Augmented Generation brings not only positive effects to LLMs (Liu, Zhang, and Liang 2023; Maynez et al. 2020). On one hand, there is a significant amount of noise information even fake news in the content available on the Internet, which poses challenges for search engines in accurately retrieving desirable knowledge. On the other hand, LLMs suffer from unreliable generation chal- lenge. LLMs can be misled by incorrect information con- tained in the context (Bian et al. 2023) and also suffer from hallucination during the generation (Adlakha et al. 2023), resulting in generating content that goes beyond external in- arXiv:2309.01431v2 [cs.CL] 20 Dec 2023",

However, existing research lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on different large language models, which make it challeng- ing to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systemati- cally investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Gener- ation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different large language models in 4 fundamental abili- ties required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robust- ness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the afore- mentioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diag- nose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to ef- fectively apply RAG to LLMs. Introduction Recently, there have been impressive advancements in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) and ChatGLM (THUDM 2023a). Although these models have shown remarkable general abilities (Bang et al. 2023; Guo et al. 2023), they still suffer severely from challenges includ- ing factual hallucination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes, and Junczys-Dowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023), knowledge out- dating (He, Zhang, and Roth 2022), and the lack of domain- specific expertise (Li et al. 2023c; Shen et al. 2023). Incorporating external knowledge via information re- trieval, i.e., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), has been regarded as a promising way to resolve the above chal- lenges.

With the help of external knowl- edge, LLMs can generate more accurate and reliable re- sponses. The most common method is to use a search engine as a retriever such as New Bing. Due to the vast amount of information available on the Internet, using a search engine can provide more real-time information. However, Retrieval-Augmented Generation brings not only positive effects to LLMs (Liu, Zhang, and Liang 2023; Maynez et al. 2020). On one hand, there is a significant amount of noise information even fake news in the content available on the Internet, which poses challenges for search engines in accurately retrieving desirable knowledge. On the other hand, LLMs suffer from unreliable generation chal- lenge. LLMs can be misled by incorrect information con- tained in the context (Bian et al. 2023) and also suffer from hallucination during the generation (Adlakha et al. 2023), resulting in generating content that goes beyond external in- arXiv:2309.01431v2 [cs.CL] 20 Dec 2023",

Un-\nfortunately, currently there lacks of comprehensive under-\nstanding on how these factors can influence RAG, and how\ncould each model survives from these drawbacks and im-\nprovement their performance via information retrieval. As a\nresult, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive evalua-\ntion of LLMs on their ability to effectively utilize retrieved\ninformation, as well as their ability to withstand the various\ndrawbacks present in information retrieval.\nTo this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive evalua-\ntion of RAG for current LLMs. Specifically, we create a new\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark, namely RGB,\nin both English and Chinese. In order to ensure that the in-\nternal knowledge of LLMs does not introduce bias into the\nevaluation results, RGB chooses to aggregate the latest news\ninformation and constructs queries based on the news infor-\nmation. Then, based on these queries, we use Search API to\nfetch relevant documents and select most relevant snippets\nfrom the content as external retrieved documents. Finally,\nbased on different compositions of query and document-set\npairs, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to\nevaluate the following basic abilities of LLMs according to\nthe common challenges in RAG, as shown in Figure 1:\n• Noise Robustness, which means a LLM can extract use-\nful information from noisy documents. In this paper, we\ndefine noisy documents as those that are relevant to the\nquestion but do not contain any information of the an-\nswer. For the instance in Figure 1, the noisy documents\nrelated to the question “Who was awarded the 2022 No-\nbel Prize in Literature” include reports about the 2021\nNobel Prize in Literature. To this end, the testbed for\nnoise robustness contains instances whose external doc-\numents contain a certain number of noisy documents\nbased on the desired noise ratio.\n• Negative Rejection, which means that a LLM should re-\nject to answer the question when the required knowledge\nis not present in any retrieved document. The testbed for\nnegative rejection contains instances whose external doc-\numents are only with noisy documents. LLMs are ex-\npected to indicate “insufficient information” or other re-\njection signals.\n• Information Integration , which evaluates whether\nLLMs can answer complex questions that require inte-\ngrating information from multiple documents. For the in-\nstance in Figure 1, for the question “When were the Chat-\nGPT app for iOS and ChatGPT api launched?”, LLMs\nare expected to provide information of the launch dates\nfor both the ChatGPT iOS app and ChatGPT API. The\ntestbed for information integration contains instances\nthat can only be answered using multiple documents.\n• Counterfactual Robustness, which evaluates whether\nLLMs can identify risks of known factual errors in the\nretrieved documents when the LLMs are given warnings\nabout potential risks in the retrieved information through\ninstruction. The testbed for counterfactual robustness in-\ncludes instances that can be answered directly by the\nLLMs, but the external documents contain factual errors.\nBased on RGB, we conduct evaluation on 6 state-of-\nthe-art large language models including ChatGPT (Ope-\nnAI 2022), ChatGLM-6B (THUDM 2023a), ChatGLM2-\n6B (THUDM 2023b), Vicuna-7b (Chiang et al. 2023),\nQwen-7B-Chat (QwenLM 2023), BELLE-7B (Yunjie Ji\n2023). We found that even though RAG can improve the re-\nsponse accuracy of LLMs, they still suffer from the above-\nmentioned challenges significantly. Specifically, we found\nthat even though LLMs demonstrate some level of noise ro-\nbustness, they tend to confuse similar information and fre-\nquently generate inaccurate answers when relevant informa-\ntion exists. For example, when faced with a question about\nthe 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature, if there are noisy docu-\nments about the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature in external\ndocuments, LLMs may become confused and provide inac-\ncurate answers. Besides, LLMs frequently fail to reject an-\nswering and generate incorrect answers when none of the\nexternal documents contain relevant information. Further-\nmore, LLMs lack the ability to summarize from multiple\ndocuments, and therefore if multiple documents are needed\nto answer a question, LLMs often fail to provide accurate\nanswer. Finally, we found that even when the LLMs contain\nthe required knowledge and are given warnings about po-\ntential risks in the retrieved information through instruction,\nthey still tend to trust and prioritize the retrieved information\nover their own existing knowledge. The experimental results\nmentioned above highlight the need for further resolution of\nimportant issues in the existing RAG method. Therefore, it\nis crucial to exercise caution and carefully design its usage.\nGenerally speaking, the contributions of this paper are1:\n• We proposed to evaluate four capabilities for retrieval-\naugmented generation of LLMs and created the\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark in both En-\nglish and Chinese. To best of our knowledge, it is the first\nbenchmark designed to assess these four capabilities for\nretrieval-augmented generation of LLMs.\n• We evaluated the existing LLMs using RGB and found\nthe limitations of them in the four different abilities.\n• We analyzed the responses of LLMs in RGB and identi-\nfied their current shortcomings as well as suggested di-\nrections for improvement.\nRelated work\nRetrieval-augmented models The knowledge stored in\nlarge language models is commonly out-of-date (He, Zhang,\nand Roth 2022) and they also sometimes generate hallu-\ncination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes, and Junczys-\nDowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023) i.e., they may generate ir-\nrelevant or factually incorrect contents.

The testbed for counterfactual robustness in- cludes instances that can be answered directly by the LLMs, but the external documents contain factual errors. Based on RGB, we conduct evaluation on 6 state-of- the-art large language models including ChatGPT (Ope- nAI 2022), ChatGLM-6B (THUDM 2023a), ChatGLM2- 6B (THUDM 2023b), Vicuna-7b (Chiang et al. 2023), Qwen-7B-Chat (QwenLM 2023), BELLE-7B (Yunjie Ji 2023). We found that even though RAG can improve the re- sponse accuracy of LLMs, they still suffer from the above- mentioned challenges significantly. Specifically, we found that even though LLMs demonstrate some level of noise ro- bustness, they tend to confuse similar information and fre- quently generate inaccurate answers when relevant informa- tion exists. For example, when faced with a question about the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature, if there are noisy docu- ments about the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature in external documents, LLMs may become confused and provide inac- curate answers. Besides, LLMs frequently fail to reject an- swering and generate incorrect answers when none of the external documents contain relevant information. Further- more, LLMs lack the ability to summarize from multiple documents, and therefore if multiple documents are needed to answer a question, LLMs often fail to provide accurate answer. Finally, we found that even when the LLMs contain the required knowledge and are given warnings about po- tential risks in the retrieved information through instruction, they still tend to trust and prioritize the retrieved information over their own existing knowledge. The experimental results mentioned above highlight the need for further resolution of important issues in the existing RAG method. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution and carefully design its usage. Generally speaking, the contributions of this paper are1: • We proposed to evaluate four capabilities for retrieval- augmented generation of LLMs and created the Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark in both En- glish and Chinese. To best of our knowledge, it is the first benchmark designed to assess these four capabilities for retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs. • We evaluated the existing LLMs using RGB and found the limitations of them in the four different abilities. • We analyzed the responses of LLMs in RGB and identi- fied their current shortcomings as well as suggested di- rections for improvement.

By using external knowledge as guidance, retrieval-augmented models can generate more accurate and reliable responses (Guu et al. 2020; Lewis et al. 2020; Borgeaud et al. 2022; Izacard et al. 2022; Shi et al. 2023; Ren et al. 2023).

          "page_content": "formation. These challenges result in LLMs being unable to consistently generate reliable and accurate responses. Un- fortunately, currently there lacks of comprehensive under- standing on how these factors can influence RAG, and how could each model survives from these drawbacks and im- provement their performance via information retrieval. As a result, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive evalua- tion of LLMs on their ability to effectively utilize retrieved information, as well as their ability to withstand the various drawbacks present in information retrieval. To this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive evalua- tion of RAG for current LLMs. Specifically, we create a new Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark, namely RGB, in both English and Chinese. In order to ensure that the in- ternal knowledge of LLMs does not introduce bias into the evaluation results, RGB chooses to aggregate the latest news information and constructs queries based on the news infor- mation. Then, based on these queries, we use Search API to fetch relevant documents and select most relevant snippets from the content as external retrieved documents. Finally, based on different compositions of query and document-set pairs, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the following basic abilities of LLMs according to the common challenges in RAG, as shown in Figure 1: • Noise Robustness, which means a LLM can extract use- ful information from noisy documents. In this paper, we define noisy documents as those that are relevant to the question but do not contain any information of the an- swer. For the instance in Figure 1, the noisy documents related to the question “Who was awarded the 2022 No- bel Prize in Literature” include reports about the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature. To this end, the testbed for noise robustness contains instances whose external doc- uments contain a certain number of noisy documents based on the desired noise ratio. • Negative Rejection, which means that a LLM should re- ject to answer the question when the required knowledge is not present in any retrieved document. The testbed for negative rejection contains instances whose external doc- uments are only with noisy documents. LLMs are ex- pected to indicate “insufficient information” or other re- jection signals. • Information Integration , which evaluates whether LLMs can answer complex questions that require inte- grating information from multiple documents. For the in- stance in Figure 1, for the question “When were the Chat- GPT app for iOS and ChatGPT api launched?”, LLMs are expected to provide information of the launch dates for both the ChatGPT iOS app and ChatGPT API. The testbed for information integration contains instances that can only be answered using multiple documents.",

Recently, with the development of large mod-\nels, a series of retrieval-enhanced tools and products have\ngained widespread attention, such as ChatGPT retrieval plu-\ngin, Langchain, New Bing, etc. However, in real-world sce-\nnarios, the retrieved text inevitably contains noise. There-\nfore, in this paper we conducted a systematic evaluation and\nanalysis of retrieval-augmented generation in LLMs.\nEvaluation of LLMs Evaluating LLMs has received sig-\nnificant attention due to their remarkable general capabil-\nity (Chang et al. 2023). It enables us to gain a deeper under-\nstanding of the specific abilities and limitations of LLMs,\nwhile also providing valuable guidance for future research.\nIn the past, benchmarks such as GLUE (Wang et al. 2019b)\nand SuperCLUE (Wang et al. 2019a) primarily focused on\nevaluating NLP tasks, particularly in natural language un-\nderstanding. However, these evaluations often fail to fully\ncapture the capabilities of LLMs. MMLU (Hendrycks et al.\n2021) was then proposed to measure the knowledge acquired\nby language models when pre-training. Recently, with the\ndevelopment of LLMs, a series of general evaluation bench-\nmarks have emerged, such as AGIEval (Zhong et al. 2023),\nC-Eval (Huang et al. 2023), AlpacaEval (Li et al. 2023b),\nOpenLLM Leaderboard (Edward Beeching 2023), etc. In\naddition to general abilities, there are also specific bench-\nmarks that focus on evaluating the capabilities of models.\nFor example, CValues (Xu et al. 2023a) focuses on the safety\nand responsibility of LLMs, M3Exam (Zhang et al. 2023)\nfocuses on human exam and ToolBench (Qin et al. 2023)\nevaluates how well LLMs use external tools. Recently, Ad-\nlakha et al. (2023) evaluate the RAG of LLMs in exist QA\ndataset. Different from their work, we focus on 4 required\nabilities of RAG and create Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion Benchmark to evaluate the LLMs.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark\nIn this section, we first introduce the specific retrieval-\naugmented generation abilities we aim to evaluate. Next, we\noutline the process of constructing the RAG benchmark for\nevaluation. Lastly, we present the evaluation metrics.\nRequired abilities of RAG\nExternal knowledge is the key to resolving the problems\nof LLMs such as hallucination and outdated knowledge,\nwhich can make LLMs generate more accurate and reliable\nresponses through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nHowever, LLMs cannot always response as expected with\nRAG. For one thing, there are numerous irrelevant docu-\nments and false information on the Internet. Incorporating\nthese external documents into LLMs could have a detrimen-\ntal effect. For anthoer, LLMs suffer from the unreliable gen-\neration challenge. The generation of LLMs is often unpre-\ndictable, and we cannot guarantee that they will utilize the\nuseful information entailed in the external documents. Ad-\nditionally, LLMs can easily be misled by incorrect infor-\nmation in the document. To this end, we build Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation Benchmark (RGB) to evaluate the\nretrieval-augmented generation of LLMs, and we concern\nabout 4 specific abilities:\nNoise Robustness is the robustness of LLMs in noisy\ndocuments. As retrievers are not perfect, the external knowl-\nedge they retrieve often contains a significant amount of\nnoise, i.e., documents which are relevant to the question but\ndo not contain any information about the answer. To effec-\ntively answer user questions, LLMs must be able to extract\nthe necessary information from documents despite there are\nnoisy documents.\nNegative Rejectionis a measure of whether LLMs can\ndecline to answer a question when none of the contexts pro-\nvide useful information. In real-world situations, the search\nengine often fails to retrieve documents containing the an-\nswers. In these cases, it is important for the model to have\nthe capability to reject recognition and avoid generating mis-\nleading content.\nInformation Integration is a capacity to integrate an-\nswers from multiple documents. In many cases, the an-\nswer to a question may be contained in multiple documents.\nFor example, for the question “Who are the champions of\nthe U.S. Open 2022 men’s and women’s singles?”, the two\nchampions may be mentioned in different documents. In or-\nder to provide better answers to complex questions, it is nec-\nessary for LLMs to have the ability to integrate information.\nCounterfactual Robustnessrefers to a capacity to han-\ndle errors in external knowledge. In the real world, there is\nan abundance of false information on the internet. Please",

Recently, Ad-\nlakha et al. (2023) evaluate the RAG of LLMs in exist QA\ndataset. Different from their work, we focus on 4 required\nabilities of RAG and create Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion Benchmark to evaluate the LLMs.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark\nIn this section, we first introduce the specific retrieval-\naugmented generation abilities we aim to evaluate. Next, we\noutline the process of constructing the RAG benchmark for\nevaluation. Lastly, we present the evaluation metrics.\nRequired abilities of RAG\nExternal knowledge is the key to resolving the problems\nof LLMs such as hallucination and outdated knowledge,\nwhich can make LLMs generate more accurate and reliable\nresponses through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nHowever, LLMs cannot always response as expected with\nRAG. For one thing, there are numerous irrelevant docu-\nments and false information on the Internet. Incorporating\nthese external documents into LLMs could have a detrimen-\ntal effect. For anthoer, LLMs suffer from the unreliable gen-\neration challenge. The generation of LLMs is often unpre-\ndictable, and we cannot guarantee that they will utilize the\nuseful information entailed in the external documents. Ad-\nditionally, LLMs can easily be misled by incorrect infor-\nmation in the document. To this end, we build Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation Benchmark (RGB) to evaluate the\nretrieval-augmented generation of LLMs, and we concern\nabout 4 specific abilities:\nNoise Robustness is the robustness of LLMs in noisy\ndocuments. As retrievers are not perfect, the external knowl-\nedge they retrieve often contains a significant amount of\nnoise, i.e., documents which are relevant to the question but\ndo not contain any information about the answer. To effec-\ntively answer user questions, LLMs must be able to extract\nthe necessary information from documents despite there are\nnoisy documents.\nNegative Rejectionis a measure of whether LLMs can\ndecline to answer a question when none of the contexts pro-\nvide useful information. In real-world situations, the search\nengine often fails to retrieve documents containing the an-\nswers. In these cases, it is important for the model to have\nthe capability to reject recognition and avoid generating mis-\nleading content.\nInformation Integration is a capacity to integrate an-\nswers from multiple documents. In many cases, the an-\nswer to a question may be contained in multiple documents.\nFor example, for the question “Who are the champions of\nthe U.S. Open 2022 men’s and women’s singles?”, the two\nchampions may be mentioned in different documents. In or-\nder to provide better answers to complex questions, it is nec-\nessary for LLMs to have the ability to integrate information.\nCounterfactual Robustnessrefers to a capacity to han-\ndle errors in external knowledge. In the real world, there is\nan abundance of false information on the internet. Please",

It focuses on 4 required abilities: Noise Robustness, Negative Rejection, Information Integration, and Counterfactual Robustness. RAG aims to utilize external knowledge to improve LLMs' accuracy and reliability. However, this process can be affected by irrelevant documents and false information. The paper proposes the Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB) to evaluate these abilities. RGB measures how well LLMs can extract necessary information from noisy documents, decline to answer questions when none of the contexts provide useful information, integrate answers from multiple documents, and handle errors in external knowledge.",

          "page_content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark In this section, we first introduce the specific retrieval- augmented generation abilities we aim to evaluate. Next, we outline the process of constructing the RAG benchmark for evaluation. Lastly, we present the evaluation metrics. Required abilities of RAG External knowledge is the key to resolving the problems of LLMs such as hallucination and outdated knowledge, which can make LLMs generate more accurate and reliable responses through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, LLMs cannot always response as expected with RAG. For one thing, there are numerous irrelevant docu- ments and false information on the Internet. Incorporating these external documents into LLMs could have a detrimen- tal effect. For anthoer, LLMs suffer from the unreliable gen- eration challenge. The generation of LLMs is often unpre- dictable, and we cannot guarantee that they will utilize the useful information entailed in the external documents. Ad- ditionally, LLMs can easily be misled by incorrect infor- mation in the document. To this end, we build Retrieval- Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB) to evaluate the retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs, and we concern about 4 specific abilities: Noise Robustness is the robustness of LLMs in noisy documents. As retrievers are not perfect, the external knowl- edge they retrieve often contains a significant amount of noise, i.e., documents which are relevant to the question but do not contain any information about the answer. To effec- tively answer user questions, LLMs must be able to extract the necessary information from documents despite there are noisy documents. Negative Rejectionis a measure of whether LLMs can decline to answer a question when none of the contexts pro- vide useful information. In real-world situations, the search engine often fails to retrieve documents containing the an- swers. In these cases, it is important for the model to have the capability to reject recognition and avoid generating mis- leading content. Information Integration is a capacity to integrate an- swers from multiple documents. In many cases, the an- swer to a question may be contained in multiple documents. For example, for the question “Who are the champions of the U.S. Open 2022 men’s and women’s singles?”, the two champions may be mentioned in different documents. In or- der to provide better answers to complex questions, it is nec- essary for LLMs to have the ability to integrate information. Counterfactual Robustnessrefers to a capacity to han- dle errors in external knowledge. In the real world, there is an abundance of false information on the internet. Please",

Recently, with the development of large mod- els, a series of retrieval-enhanced tools and products have gained widespread attention, such as ChatGPT retrieval plu- gin, Langchain, New Bing, etc. However, in real-world sce- narios, the retrieved text inevitably contains noise. There- fore, in this paper we conducted a systematic evaluation and analysis of retrieval-augmented generation in LLMs. Evaluation of LLMs Evaluating LLMs has received sig- nificant attention due to their remarkable general capabil- ity (Chang et al. 2023). It enables us to gain a deeper under- standing of the specific abilities and limitations of LLMs, while also providing valuable guidance for future research. In the past, benchmarks such as GLUE (Wang et al. 2019b) and SuperCLUE (Wang et al. 2019a) primarily focused on evaluating NLP tasks, particularly in natural language un- derstanding. However, these evaluations often fail to fully capture the capabilities of LLMs. MMLU (Hendrycks et al. 2021) was then proposed to measure the knowledge acquired by language models when pre-training. Recently, with the development of LLMs, a series of general evaluation bench- marks have emerged, such as AGIEval (Zhong et al. 2023), C-Eval (Huang et al. 2023), AlpacaEval (Li et al. 2023b), OpenLLM Leaderboard (Edward Beeching 2023), etc. In addition to general abilities, there are also specific bench- marks that focus on evaluating the capabilities of models. For example, CValues (Xu et al. 2023a) focuses on the safety and responsibility of LLMs, M3Exam (Zhang et al. 2023) focuses on human exam and ToolBench (Qin et al. 2023) evaluates how well LLMs use external tools. Recently, Ad- lakha et al. (2023) evaluate the RAG of LLMs in exist QA dataset. Different from their work, we focus on 4 required abilities of RAG and create Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion Benchmark to evaluate the LLMs.",

          "page_content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark In this section, we first introduce the specific retrieval- augmented generation abilities we aim to evaluate. Next, we outline the process of constructing the RAG benchmark for evaluation. Lastly, we present the evaluation metrics. Required abilities of RAG External knowledge is the key to resolving the problems of LLMs such as hallucination and outdated knowledge, which can make LLMs generate more accurate and reliable responses through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, LLMs cannot always response as expected with RAG. For one thing, there are numerous irrelevant docu- ments and false information on the Internet. Incorporating these external documents into LLMs could have a detrimen- tal effect. For anthoer, LLMs suffer from the unreliable gen- eration challenge. The generation of LLMs is often unpre- dictable, and we cannot guarantee that they will utilize the useful information entailed in the external documents. Ad- ditionally, LLMs can easily be misled by incorrect infor- mation in the document. To this end, we build Retrieval- Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB) to evaluate the retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs, and we concern about 4 specific abilities: Noise Robustness is the robustness of LLMs in noisy documents. As retrievers are not perfect, the external knowl- edge they retrieve often contains a significant amount of noise, i.e., documents which are relevant to the question but do not contain any information about the answer. To effec- tively answer user questions, LLMs must be able to extract the necessary information from documents despite there are noisy documents. Negative Rejectionis a measure of whether LLMs can decline to answer a question when none of the contexts pro- vide useful information. In real-world situations, the search engine often fails to retrieve documents containing the an- swers. In these cases, it is important for the model to have the capability to reject recognition and avoid generating mis- leading content. Information Integration is a capacity to integrate an- swers from multiple documents. In many cases, the an- swer to a question may be contained in multiple documents. For example, for the question “Who are the champions of the U.S. Open 2022 men’s and women’s singles?”, the two champions may be mentioned in different documents. In or- der to provide better answers to complex questions, it is nec- essary for LLMs to have the ability to integrate information. Counterfactual Robustnessrefers to a capacity to han- dle errors in external knowledge. In the real world, there is an abundance of false information on the internet. Please",

We evaluate the\nLLMs by judging the retrieval-augmented responses of them\nto the questions. To simulate real-world scenarios, we con-\nstruct question and answer data using actual news articles.\nDue to the abundance of knowledge contained within the\nLLMs there is a potential for bias when measuring the first\nthree abilities. To mitigate this, the instances of RGB are\nconstructed by latest news articles. Additionally, we retrieve\nexternal documents from Internet through search engines.\nFinally, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds\nto evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. The overall\nprocedure of our data construction is illustrated in Figure 2.\nQA instances generation.We first collect latest news ar-\nticles and use prompts to make ChatGPT generate events,\nquestions, and answers for each articles. For example, as\nshown in the Figure 2, for a report about “The 2022 Nobel\nPrize”, ChatGPT will generate corresponding event, ques-\ntion and provide key information for answering it. By gen-\nerating events, the model is able to preliminarily filter out\nnews articles that do not contain any events. After genera-\ntion, we manually check the answer and filter out data that\nis difficult to retrieve through search engines.\nRetrieve using search engine.For each query, we use\nGoogle’s API to fetch 10 relevant web pages and extract\ncorresponding snippets of text from them. Simultaneously,\nwe read these web pages and convert their textual content\ninto text chunks with a maximum length of 300 tokens. Us-\ning an existing dense retrieval model 2, we select the top-30\ntext chunks that match the query most effectively. These re-\ntrieved text chunks, along with the snippets provided by the\nsearch API, will serve as our external documents. These doc-\numents will be divided into positive documents and negative\ndocuments based on whether they contain the answer.\nTestbeds construction for each ability.We expand the\ncorpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above\nbasic abilities of LLMs. To evaluate the noise robustness,\nwe sample varying numbers of negative documents ac-\ncording to the desired ratio of noises. For negative rejec-\ntion, all the external documents are sampled from negative\ndocuments. For the information integration ability, we fur-\nther construct data based on the above generated questions.\nThis involves expanding or rewriting these questions so that\ntheir answers encompass multiple aspects. For example, the\nquestion “Who won the MVP of Super Bowl 2023?” can\nbe rewrite as “Who won the MVPs of Super Bowl 2022\nand 2023?”.

Dif-\nferent from the first three abilities, the data of counterfactual\nrobustness is constructed solely based on the internal knowl-\nedge of the model. Based on the aforementioned generated\nquestions mentioned above, we adopt ChatGPT to automat-\nically generate its known knowledge. Specifically, we use\nprompts to allow the model to generate both questions and\nanswers that are already known. For example, based on the\nquestion “Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Phys-\niology and Medicine?”, the model will generate the known\nquestion “Who was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Lit-\nerature?” and answer “ Abdulrazak Gurnah”. We then man-\nually verified the generated answers, and retrieve relevant\ndocuments as described above. In order to make documents\ncontain factual errors, we manually modify the answers and\nreplace the corresponding parts in the document.\nFinally, we collect totally 600 base questions in RGB,\nand 200 additional questions for the information integration\nability and 200 additional questions for counterfactual ro-\nbustness ability. Half of the instances are in English, and the\nother half are in Chinese.\nEvaluation metrics\nThe core of this benchmark is to evaluate whether LLMs can\nutilize the provided external documents to acquire knowl-\nedge and generate reasonable answers. We evaluate the re-\nsponses of LLMs in order to measure above-mentioned four\nabilities of them.\nAccuracy is used to measure noise robustness and infor-\nmation integration. We employ an exact matching approach\nwhere if the generated text contains an exact match to the\nanswer, it is considered as a correct answer.\nRejection rate is used to measure negative rejection.\nWhen only noisy documents are provided, LLMs should\noutput the specific content – “I can not answer the question\nbecause of the insufficient information in documents.” (We\nuse instructions to inform the model.). If the model gener-\nates this content, it indicates a successful rejection.\nError detection ratemeasures whether the model can\ndetect the factual errors in the documents for counterfactual\nrobustness. When the provided documents contain factual\nerrors, the model should output the specific content – “There\nare factual errors in the provided documents.” (We use in-",

In real-world scenarios, it is not possible to obtain per- fect documents with all the necessary external knowledge. Therefore, evaluating these four abilities of the model be- comes essential in order to measure the RAG of LLMs. Data construction Inspired by previous benchmarks for LLMs, RGB utilizes a question-answering format for evaluation. We evaluate the LLMs by judging the retrieval-augmented responses of them to the questions. To simulate real-world scenarios, we con- struct question and answer data using actual news articles. Due to the abundance of knowledge contained within the LLMs there is a potential for bias when measuring the first three abilities. To mitigate this, the instances of RGB are constructed by latest news articles. Additionally, we retrieve external documents from Internet through search engines. Finally, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. The overall procedure of our data construction is illustrated in Figure 2. QA instances generation.We first collect latest news ar- ticles and use prompts to make ChatGPT generate events, questions, and answers for each articles. For example, as shown in the Figure 2, for a report about “The 2022 Nobel Prize”, ChatGPT will generate corresponding event, ques- tion and provide key information for answering it. By gen- erating events, the model is able to preliminarily filter out news articles that do not contain any events. After genera- tion, we manually check the answer and filter out data that is difficult to retrieve through search engines. Retrieve using search engine.For each query, we use Google’s API to fetch 10 relevant web pages and extract corresponding snippets of text from them. Simultaneously, we read these web pages and convert their textual content into text chunks with a maximum length of 300 tokens. Us- ing an existing dense retrieval model 2, we select the top-30 text chunks that match the query most effectively. These re- trieved text chunks, along with the snippets provided by the search API, will serve as our external documents. These doc- uments will be divided into positive documents and negative documents based on whether they contain the answer. Testbeds construction for each ability.We expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. To evaluate the noise robustness, we sample varying numbers of negative documents ac- cording to the desired ratio of noises. For negative rejec- tion, all the external documents are sampled from negative documents. For the information integration ability, we fur- ther construct data based on the above generated questions. This involves expanding or rewriting these questions so that their answers encompass multiple aspects. For example, the question “Who won the MVP of Super Bowl 2023?” can be rewrite as “Who won the MVPs of Super Bowl 2022 and 2023?”. Consequently, answering such questions re- 2Chinese: https://huggingface.co/moka-ai/m3e-base; English: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2.",

We evaluate the\nLLMs by judging the retrieval-augmented responses of them\nto the questions. To simulate real-world scenarios, we con-\nstruct question and answer data using actual news articles.\nDue to the abundance of knowledge contained within the\nLLMs there is a potential for bias when measuring the first\nthree abilities. To mitigate this, the instances of RGB are\nconstructed by latest news articles. Additionally, we retrieve\nexternal documents from Internet through search engines.\nFinally, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds\nto evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. The overall\nprocedure of our data construction is illustrated in Figure 2.\nQA instances generation.We first collect latest news ar-\nticles and use prompts to make ChatGPT generate events,\nquestions, and answers for each articles. For example, as\nshown in the Figure 2, for a report about “The 2022 Nobel\nPrize”, ChatGPT will generate corresponding event, ques-\ntion and provide key information for answering it. By gen-\nerating events, the model is able to preliminarily filter out\nnews articles that do not contain any events. After genera-\ntion, we manually check the answer and filter out data that\nis difficult to retrieve through search engines.\nRetrieve using search engine.For each query, we use\nGoogle’s API to fetch 10 relevant web pages and extract\ncorresponding snippets of text from them. Simultaneously,\nwe read these web pages and convert their textual content\ninto text chunks with a maximum length of 300 tokens. Us-\ning an existing dense retrieval model 2, we select the top-30\ntext chunks that match the query most effectively. These re-\ntrieved text chunks, along with the snippets provided by the\nsearch API, will serve as our external documents. These doc-\numents will be divided into positive documents and negative\ndocuments based on whether they contain the answer.\nTestbeds construction for each ability.We expand the\ncorpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above\nbasic abilities of LLMs. To evaluate the noise robustness,\nwe sample varying numbers of negative documents ac-\ncording to the desired ratio of noises. For negative rejec-\ntion, all the external documents are sampled from negative\ndocuments. For the information integration ability, we fur-\nther construct data based on the above generated questions.\nThis involves expanding or rewriting these questions so that\ntheir answers encompass multiple aspects. For example, the\nquestion “Who won the MVP of Super Bowl 2023?” can\nbe rewrite as “Who won the MVPs of Super Bowl 2022\nand 2023?”. Consequently, answering such questions re-\n2Chinese: https://huggingface.co/moka-ai/m3e-base; English:\nhttps://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2.\nSystem instruction\nYou are an accurate and reliable AI assistant that can \nanswer questions with the help of external documents. \nPlease note that external documents may contain noisy \nor factually incorrect information. If the information in \nthe document contains the correct answer, you will give \nan accurate answer. If the information in the document \ndoes not contain the answer, you will generate ’I can not \nanswer the question because of the insufficient \ninformation in documents.‘ If there are inconsistencies \nwith the facts in some of the documents, please generate \nthe response 'There are factual errors in the provided \ndocuments.' and provide the correct answer.\nUser input Instruction\nDocument:\\n{DOCS} \\n\\nQuestion:\\n{QUERY}\nSystem instruction\n你是一个准确和可靠的人工智能助手，\n能够借助外部文档回答问题，请注意\n外部文档可能存在噪声事实性错误。\n如果文档中的信息包含了正确答案，\n你将进行准确的回答。如果文档中的\n信息不包含答案，你将生成“文档信\n息不足，因此我无法基于提供的文档\n回答该问题。”如果部分文档中存在\n与事实不一致的错误，请先生成“提\n供文档的文档存在事实性错误。”，\n并生成正确答案。\nUser input Instruction\n文档：\\n{DOCS} \\n\\n问题：\\n{QUERY}\nEnglish Chinese\nFigure 3: The instructions used in our experiments, which\ninclude a system instruction followed by a user input instruc-\ntion.

Dif-\nferent from the first three abilities, the data of counterfactual\nrobustness is constructed solely based on the internal knowl-\nedge of the model. Based on the aforementioned generated\nquestions mentioned above, we adopt ChatGPT to automat-\nically generate its known knowledge. Specifically, we use\nprompts to allow the model to generate both questions and\nanswers that are already known. For example, based on the\nquestion “Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Phys-\niology and Medicine?”, the model will generate the known\nquestion “Who was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Lit-\nerature?” and answer “ Abdulrazak Gurnah”. We then man-\nually verified the generated answers, and retrieve relevant\ndocuments as described above. In order to make documents\ncontain factual errors, we manually modify the answers and\nreplace the corresponding parts in the document.\nFinally, we collect totally 600 base questions in RGB,\nand 200 additional questions for the information integration\nability and 200 additional questions for counterfactual ro-\nbustness ability. Half of the instances are in English, and the\nother half are in Chinese.\nEvaluation metrics\nThe core of this benchmark is to evaluate whether LLMs can\nutilize the provided external documents to acquire knowl-\nedge and generate reasonable answers. We evaluate the re-\nsponses of LLMs in order to measure above-mentioned four\nabilities of them.\nAccuracy is used to measure noise robustness and infor-\nmation integration. We employ an exact matching approach\nwhere if the generated text contains an exact match to the\nanswer, it is considered as a correct answer.\nRejection rate is used to measure negative rejection.\nWhen only noisy documents are provided, LLMs should\noutput the specific content – “I can not answer the question\nbecause of the insufficient information in documents.” (We\nuse instructions to inform the model.). If the model gener-\nates this content, it indicates a successful rejection.\nError detection ratemeasures whether the model can\ndetect the factual errors in the documents for counterfactual\nrobustness. When the provided documents contain factual\nerrors, the model should output the specific content – “There\nare factual errors in the provided documents.” (We use in-",

Dif- ferent from the first three abilities, the data of counterfactual robustness is constructed solely based on the internal knowl- edge of the model. Based on the aforementioned generated questions mentioned above, we adopt ChatGPT to automat- ically generate its known knowledge. Specifically, we use prompts to allow the model to generate both questions and answers that are already known. For example, based on the question “Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Phys- iology and Medicine?”, the model will generate the known question “Who was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Lit- erature?” and answer “ Abdulrazak Gurnah”. We then man- ually verified the generated answers, and retrieve relevant documents as described above. In order to make documents contain factual errors, we manually modify the answers and replace the corresponding parts in the document. Finally, we collect totally 600 base questions in RGB, and 200 additional questions for the information integration ability and 200 additional questions for counterfactual ro- bustness ability. Half of the instances are in English, and the other half are in Chinese. Evaluation metrics The core of this benchmark is to evaluate whether LLMs can utilize the provided external documents to acquire knowl- edge and generate reasonable answers. We evaluate the re- sponses of LLMs in order to measure above-mentioned four abilities of them. Accuracy is used to measure noise robustness and infor- mation integration. We employ an exact matching approach where if the generated text contains an exact match to the answer, it is considered as a correct answer. Rejection rate is used to measure negative rejection. When only noisy documents are provided, LLMs should output the specific content – “I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.” (We use instructions to inform the model.). If the model gener- ates this content, it indicates a successful rejection. Error detection ratemeasures whether the model can detect the factual errors in the documents for counterfactual robustness. When the provided documents contain factual errors, the model should output the specific content – “There are factual errors in the provided documents.” (We use in-",

          "page_content": "note that we only evaluate the situation that LLMs are given warnings about potential risks in the retrieved information through instruction. In real-world scenarios, it is not possible to obtain per- fect documents with all the necessary external knowledge. Therefore, evaluating these four abilities of the model be- comes essential in order to measure the RAG of LLMs. Data construction Inspired by previous benchmarks for LLMs, RGB utilizes a question-answering format for evaluation. We evaluate the LLMs by judging the retrieval-augmented responses of them to the questions. To simulate real-world scenarios, we con- struct question and answer data using actual news articles. Due to the abundance of knowledge contained within the LLMs there is a potential for bias when measuring the first three abilities. To mitigate this, the instances of RGB are constructed by latest news articles. Additionally, we retrieve external documents from Internet through search engines. Finally, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. The overall procedure of our data construction is illustrated in Figure 2. QA instances generation.We first collect latest news ar- ticles and use prompts to make ChatGPT generate events, questions, and answers for each articles. For example, as shown in the Figure 2, for a report about “The 2022 Nobel Prize”, ChatGPT will generate corresponding event, ques- tion and provide key information for answering it. By gen- erating events, the model is able to preliminarily filter out news articles that do not contain any events. After genera- tion, we manually check the answer and filter out data that is difficult to retrieve through search engines. Retrieve using search engine.For each query, we use Google’s API to fetch 10 relevant web pages and extract corresponding snippets of text from them. Simultaneously, we read these web pages and convert their textual content into text chunks with a maximum length of 300 tokens. Us- ing an existing dense retrieval model 2, we select the top-30 text chunks that match the query most effectively. These re- trieved text chunks, along with the snippets provided by the search API, will serve as our external documents. These doc- uments will be divided into positive documents and negative documents based on whether they contain the answer. Testbeds construction for each ability.We expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. To evaluate the noise robustness, we sample varying numbers of negative documents ac- cording to the desired ratio of noises. For negative rejec- tion, all the external documents are sampled from negative documents. For the information integration ability, we fur- ther construct data based on the above generated questions. This involves expanding or rewriting these questions so that their answers encompass multiple aspects. For example, the question “Who won the MVP of Super Bowl 2023?” can be rewrite as “Who won the MVPs of Super Bowl 2022 and 2023?”. Consequently, answering such questions re- 2Chinese: https://huggingface.co/moka-ai/m3e-base; English: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2.",

Dif- ferent from the first three abilities, the data of counterfactual robustness is constructed solely based on the internal knowl- edge of the model. Based on the aforementioned generated questions mentioned above, we adopt ChatGPT to automat- ically generate its known knowledge. Specifically, we use prompts to allow the model to generate both questions and answers that are already known. For example, based on the question “Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Phys- iology and Medicine?”, the model will generate the known question “Who was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Lit- erature?” and answer “ Abdulrazak Gurnah”. We then man- ually verified the generated answers, and retrieve relevant documents as described above. In order to make documents contain factual errors, we manually modify the answers and replace the corresponding parts in the document. Finally, we collect totally 600 base questions in RGB, and 200 additional questions for the information integration ability and 200 additional questions for counterfactual ro- bustness ability. Half of the instances are in English, and the other half are in Chinese. Evaluation metrics The core of this benchmark is to evaluate whether LLMs can utilize the provided external documents to acquire knowl- edge and generate reasonable answers. We evaluate the re- sponses of LLMs in order to measure above-mentioned four abilities of them. Accuracy is used to measure noise robustness and infor- mation integration. We employ an exact matching approach where if the generated text contains an exact match to the answer, it is considered as a correct answer. Rejection rate is used to measure negative rejection. When only noisy documents are provided, LLMs should output the specific content – “I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.” (We use instructions to inform the model.). If the model gener- ates this content, it indicates a successful rejection. Error detection ratemeasures whether the model can detect the factual errors in the documents for counterfactual robustness. When the provided documents contain factual errors, the model should output the specific content – “There are factual errors in the provided documents.” (We use in-",

          "page_content": "on the internet. In such cases, it is typical for the question’s\ninformation to be initially presented at the start of the doc-\nument and subsequently referred to using pronouns. In Ta-\nble 2, the question information (“Qatar Open 2022”) is only\nmentioned once at the beginning and is far from where the\nanswer text “Anett Kontaveit” appears. This situation may\ncause LLMs to depend on information from other docu-\nments and create false impressions, i.e., hallucination.\n(2) Evidence uncertainty. Before highly anticipated\nevents, like the release of new Apple products or the an-\nnouncement of the Oscars, there is often a significant\namount of speculative information circulating on the inter-\nnet. Although the relevant documents explicitly state that\nit is uncertain or speculative content, they can still impact\non the retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs. In Table 2,\nwhen the noise ratio increases, the content of erroneous\ndocuments is all about some people’s predictions about the\nname of the headset (“Apple Reality Pro”). Even if there is\na correct answer (“Vision Pro”) in the relevant documents,\nLLMs can still be misled by uncertain evidences.\n(3) Concept confusion.The concepts in external docu-\nments may be similar to, but different from, the concepts in\nthe question. This can cause confusion for LLMs and make\nLLMs generate incorrect answers. In Table 2, the model an-\nswer focuses on the concept “automotive revenue” in the\ndocument rather than “revenue” in the question.\nBased on the analysis above, we have identified certain\nlimitations in LLMs regarding retrieval-augmented genera-\ntion. To effectively handle the vast amount of noise present\non the internet, further detailed enhancements are required\nfor the model such as long documents modeling and precise\nconcept comprehension.\nResults on Negative Rejection testbed\nWe evaluated the rejection rate when only noise documents\nwere provided. The results are shown in Table 3. In addi-\ntion to evaluating the rejection rate through exact matching\n(Rej in Table 3), we also utilize ChatGPT to determine if\nthe responses from the LLMs contain any rejection informa-\ntion (Rej∗ in Table 3). We can see that: Negative Rejection\nposes a challenge for RAG in LLMs.The highest rejection\nrates for LLMs in English and Chinese were only 45% and\n43.33%, respectively. This suggests that LLMs can be easily\nmisled by noisy documents, leading to incorrect answers.\nIn addition, through comparing Rej and Rej ∗, we found\nthat LLMs fail to strictly follow instructions, and they often\ngenerate unpredictable responses, which make it hard to use\nthem as state triggers (such as for recognizing rejection).\nWe conduct case studies in Table 4. The first error is\nbecause of Evidence uncertainty. Although the document\nonly mentions contact with “Adam McKay” and does not\nexplicitly state that he is the director of the movie, the\nmodel still concludes that he holds this role. The first er-\nror is because of Concept confusion. The information pro-\nvided in the answer pertains to “the 2018 Winter Olympics”\ninstead of “the 2022 Olympics” mentioned in the question.\nRetrieval-augmented generation poses a greater challenge of\nnegative rejection compared to answer directly as it presents\nrelevant documents that could potentially mislead the LLMs\nLanguages English Chinese\nRej Rej ∗ Rej Rej ∗\nChatGPT 24.67 45.00 5.33 43.33\nChatGLM-6B 9.00 25.00 6.33 17.00\nChatGLM2-6B10.33 41.33 6.33 36.33\nVicuna-7B-v1.317.00 33.33 3.37 24.67\nQwen-7B-Chat31.00 35.67 8.67 25.33\nBELLE-7B-2M5.67 32.33 5.33 13.67\nTable 3: The result of negative rejection.

Therefore, the answer is Adam McKay.\nWhich country won themost medals at the2022 Winter Olympics?Norway\nBased on the information provided in thedocument, the country that won the most medalsat the 2022 Winter Olympics is Germany.Germany has won a total of 31 medals, including 14gold medals, 14 bronze medals, and 31 silver medals.\nTable 4: Error cases of negative rejection generated by\nChatGLM2-6B. The red text highlights the error answers.\nand result in incorrect responses. In future developments, it\nwill be crucial for LLMs to enhance their ability to accu-\nrately match questions with the appropriate documents.\nResults on Information Integration testbed\nWe evaluated the accuracy based on the different noise ratios\nin external documents, and the results are shown in Table 5.\nWhen comparing the model to Table 1, we observed that\nit has a weak information integration ability, which in turn\naffects its noise robustness. We can see that:\n(1) Information integration poses a challenge for RAG\nin LLMs.Even without noise, the highest accuracy of LLMs\ncan only reach 60% and 67% for English and Chinese,\nrespectively. After adding noise, the highest accuracy de-\ncreases to 43% and 55%. These results suggest that LLMs\nstruggle with integrating information effectively and are not\nwell-suited for directly answering complex questions.\n(2) Complex questions are more challenging for RAG\nwith noisy documents.Performance decline becomes sig-\nnificant when the noise ratio is 0.4, but for simple problems,\na significant decline occurs only at a noise ratio of 0.8 at a\nsignificance level of 0.05. This indicates that complex prob-\nlems are more vulnerable to interference from noise. We\nspeculate that this is because solving complex problems re-\nquires integrating information from multiple documents, and\nthis information can be considered as noise to each other,\nmaking it harder for the model to extract relevant informa-\ntion from the documents.\nError Analysis. We conducted an error analysis on\nChatGLM2-6B (noise ratio is 0). Apart from the similar er-\nrors founded in the noise robustness experiment (38% of the\ntotal), there are also three types of unique errors. We have\npresented these cases in Table 6.",

In Table 2, the model an-\nswer focuses on the concept “automotive revenue” in the\ndocument rather than “revenue” in the question.\nBased on the analysis above, we have identified certain\nlimitations in LLMs regarding retrieval-augmented genera-\ntion.

The results are shown in Table 3. In addi-\ntion to evaluating the rejection rate through exact matching\n(Rej in Table 3), we also utilize ChatGPT to determine if\nthe responses from the LLMs contain any rejection informa-\ntion (Rej∗ in Table 3). We can see that: Negative Rejection\nposes a challenge for RAG in LLMs.The highest rejection\nrates for LLMs in English and Chinese were only 45% and\n43.33%, respectively. This suggests that LLMs can be easily\nmisled by noisy documents, leading to incorrect answers.\nIn addition, through comparing Rej and Rej ∗, we found\nthat LLMs fail to strictly follow instructions, and they often\ngenerate unpredictable responses, which make it hard to use\nthem as state triggers (such as for recognizing rejection).\nWe conduct case studies in Table 4. The first error is\nbecause of Evidence uncertainty. Although the document\nonly mentions contact with “Adam McKay” and does not\nexplicitly state that he is the director of the movie, the\nmodel still concludes that he holds this role. The first er-\nror is because of Concept confusion. The information pro-\nvided in the answer pertains to “the 2018 Winter Olympics”\ninstead of “the 2022 Olympics” mentioned in the question.\nRetrieval-augmented generation poses a greater challenge of\nnegative rejection compared to answer directly as it presents\nrelevant documents that could potentially mislead the LLMs\nLanguages English Chinese\nRej Rej ∗ Rej Rej ∗\nChatGPT 24.67 45.00 5.33 43.33\nChatGLM-6B 9.00 25.00 6.33 17.00\nChatGLM2-6B10.33 41.33 6.33 36.33\nVicuna-7B-v1.317.00 33.33 3.37 24.67\nQwen-7B-Chat31.00 35.67 8.67 25.33\nBELLE-7B-2M5.67 32.33 5.33 13.67\nTable 3: The result of negative rejection.

Therefore, the answer is Adam McKay.\nWhich country won themost medals at the2022 Winter Olympics?Norway\nBased on the information provided in thedocument, the country that won the most medalsat the 2022 Winter Olympics is Germany.Germany has won a total of 31 medals, including 14gold medals, 14 bronze medals, and 31 silver medals.\nTable 4: Error cases of negative rejection generated by\nChatGLM2-6B. The red text highlights the error answers.\nand result in incorrect responses. In future developments, it\nwill be crucial for LLMs to enhance their ability to accu-\nrately match questions with the appropriate documents.\nResults on Information Integration testbed\nWe evaluated the accuracy based on the different noise ratios\nin external documents, and the results are shown in Table 5.\nWhen comparing the model to Table 1, we observed that\nit has a weak information integration ability, which in turn\naffects its noise robustness. We can see that:\n(1) Information integration poses a challenge for RAG\nin LLMs.Even without noise, the highest accuracy of LLMs\ncan only reach 60% and 67% for English and Chinese,\nrespectively. After adding noise, the highest accuracy de-\ncreases to 43% and 55%. These results suggest that LLMs\nstruggle with integrating information effectively and are not\nwell-suited for directly answering complex questions.\n(2) Complex questions are more challenging for RAG\nwith noisy documents.Performance decline becomes sig-\nnificant when the noise ratio is 0.4, but for simple problems,\na significant decline occurs only at a noise ratio of 0.8 at a\nsignificance level of 0.05. This indicates that complex prob-\nlems are more vulnerable to interference from noise. We\nspeculate that this is because solving complex problems re-\nquires integrating information from multiple documents, and\nthis information can be considered as noise to each other,\nmaking it harder for the model to extract relevant informa-\ntion from the documents.\nError Analysis. We conducted an error analysis on\nChatGLM2-6B (noise ratio is 0). Apart from the similar er-\nrors founded in the noise robustness experiment (38% of the\ntotal), there are also three types of unique errors. We have\npresented these cases in Table 6.",

In addi- tion to evaluating the rejection rate through exact matching (Rej in Table 3), we also utilize ChatGPT to determine if the responses from the LLMs contain any rejection informa- tion (Rej∗ in Table 3). We can see that: Negative Rejection poses a challenge for RAG in LLMs.The highest rejection rates for LLMs in English and Chinese were only 45% and 43.33%, respectively. This suggests that LLMs can be easily misled by noisy documents, leading to incorrect answers. In addition, through comparing Rej and Rej ∗, we found that LLMs fail to strictly follow instructions, and they often generate unpredictable responses, which make it hard to use them as state triggers (such as for recognizing rejection). We conduct case studies in Table 4. The first error is because of Evidence uncertainty. Although the document only mentions contact with “Adam McKay” and does not explicitly state that he is the director of the movie, the model still concludes that he holds this role. The first er- ror is because of Concept confusion. The information pro- vided in the answer pertains to “the 2018 Winter Olympics” instead of “the 2022 Olympics” mentioned in the question.

Therefore, the answer is Adam McKay.

Table 4: Error cases of negative rejection generated by ChatGLM2-6B. The red text highlights the error answers. and result in incorrect responses. In future developments, it will be crucial for LLMs to enhance their ability to accu- rately match questions with the appropriate documents. Results on Information Integration testbed We evaluated the accuracy based on the different noise ratios in external documents, and the results are shown in Table 5. When comparing the model to Table 1, we observed that it has a weak information integration ability, which in turn affects its noise robustness. We can see that: (1) Information integration poses a challenge for RAG in LLMs.Even without noise, the highest accuracy of LLMs can only reach 60% and 67% for English and Chinese, respectively. After adding noise, the highest accuracy de- creases to 43% and 55%. These results suggest that LLMs struggle with integrating information effectively and are not well-suited for directly answering complex questions. (2) Complex questions are more challenging for RAG with noisy documents.Performance decline becomes sig- nificant when the noise ratio is 0.4, but for simple problems, a significant decline occurs only at a noise ratio of 0.8 at a significance level of 0.05. This indicates that complex prob- lems are more vulnerable to interference from noise. We speculate that this is because solving complex problems re- quires integrating information from multiple documents, and this information can be considered as noise to each other, making it harder for the model to extract relevant informa- tion from the documents.",

In such cases, it is typical for the question’s\ninformation to be initially presented at the start of the doc-\nument and subsequently referred to using pronouns. In Ta-\nble 2, the question information (“Qatar Open 2022”) is only\nmentioned once at the beginning and is far from where the\nanswer text “Anett Kontaveit” appears. This situation may\ncause LLMs to depend on information from other docu-\nments and create false impressions, i.e., hallucination.\n(2) Evidence uncertainty. Before highly anticipated\nevents, like the release of new Apple products or the an-\nnouncement of the Oscars, there is often a significant\namount of speculative information circulating on the inter-\nnet. Although the relevant documents explicitly state that\nit is uncertain or speculative content, they can still impact\non the retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs. In Table 2,\nwhen the noise ratio increases, the content of erroneous\ndocuments is all about some people’s predictions about the\nname of the headset (“Apple Reality Pro”). Even if there is\na correct answer (“Vision Pro”) in the relevant documents,\nLLMs can still be misled by uncertain evidences.\n(3) Concept confusion.The concepts in external docu-\nments may be similar to, but different from, the concepts in\nthe question. This can cause confusion for LLMs and make\nLLMs generate incorrect answers.

In such cases, it is typical for the question’s information to be initially presented at the start of the doc- ument and subsequently referred to using pronouns. In Ta- ble 2, the question information (“Qatar Open 2022”) is only mentioned once at the beginning and is far from where the answer text “Anett Kontaveit” appears. This situation may cause LLMs to depend on information from other docu- ments and create false impressions, i.e., hallucination. (2) Evidence uncertainty. Before highly anticipated events, like the release of new Apple products or the an- nouncement of the Oscars, there is often a significant amount of speculative information circulating on the inter- net. Although the relevant documents explicitly state that it is uncertain or speculative content, they can still impact on the retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs. In Table 2, when the noise ratio increases, the content of erroneous documents is all about some people’s predictions about the name of the headset (“Apple Reality Pro”). Even if there is a correct answer (“Vision Pro”) in the relevant documents, LLMs can still be misled by uncertain evidences. (3) Concept confusion.The concepts in external docu- ments may be similar to, but different from, the concepts in the question. This can cause confusion for LLMs and make LLMs generate incorrect answers. In Table 2, the model an- swer focuses on the concept “automotive revenue” in the document rather than “revenue” in the question. Based on the analysis above, we have identified certain limitations in LLMs regarding retrieval-augmented genera- tion. To effectively handle the vast amount of noise present on the internet, further detailed enhancements are required for the model such as long documents modeling and precise concept comprehension.",

Results on Information Integration testbed We evaluated the accuracy based on the different noise ratios in external documents, and the results are shown in Table 5. When comparing the model to Table 1, we observed that it has a weak information integration ability, which in turn affects its noise robustness. We can see that: (1) Information integration poses a challenge for RAG in LLMs.Even without noise, the highest accuracy of LLMs can only reach 60% and 67% for English and Chinese, respectively. After adding noise, the highest accuracy de- creases to 43% and 55%. These results suggest that LLMs struggle with integrating information effectively and are not well-suited for directly answering complex questions. (2) Complex questions are more challenging for RAG with noisy documents.Performance decline becomes sig- nificant when the noise ratio is 0.4, but for simple problems, a significant decline occurs only at a noise ratio of 0.8 at a significance level of 0.05. This indicates that complex prob- lems are more vulnerable to interference from noise. We speculate that this is because solving complex problems re- quires integrating information from multiple documents, and this information can be considered as noise to each other, making it harder for the model to extract relevant informa- tion from the documents.",

The blue and red\ntexts represent the answers to two sub-questions.\n(1) Merging Error (28% of the total).The model some-\ntimes merges the answers of the two sub-questions, resulting\nin an error. It mistakenly uses the answer from one question\nto address both two questions. At this point, the model will\ndisregard any documents related to one sub-question. For\nexample, in Table 6, it incorrectly states that Group D is the\nWorld Cup group for both France and Germany, while in fact\nGermany is actually assigned to Group E.\n(2) Ignoring Error (28% of the total).Sometimes, the\nmodel may ignore one of the sub-questions and only answer\nthe other. This error occurs when the model lacks a complete\nunderstanding of the problem and fails to recognize that it\nconsists of multiple sub-problems. As a result, the model\nonly considers relevant documents for one sub-problem in\norder to generate an answer, disregarding the question posed\nby another sub-problem. For example, in Table 6, the model\nonly provides the answer for the MVP of Super Bowl 2022\nand does not consider 2023.\n(3) Misalignment Error (6% of the total).Sometimes,\nthe model incorrectly identifies the documents for one sub-\nquestion as the documents for another sub-question, leading\nto misaligned answers. For example, in Table 6, the third an-\nswer has two errors: an ignoring error and a misalignment er-\nror. Firstly, the model only mentioned the Best Picture of the\n2023 (95th) Academy Awards, completely disregarding the\n2022 awards. Additionally, it incorrectly stated that “CODA”\nis the Best Picture of 2023 when it was actually awarded as\nthe Best Picture in 2022.\nThe errors mentioned above are primarily caused by the\nlimited understanding of complex questions, which hinders\nthe ability to effectively utilize information from different\nsub-problems.

How-\never, these methods slow down the inference speed and can-\nnot provide timely responses.\nResults on Counterfactual Robustness testbed\nIn order to ensure that LLMs possess relevant knowledge,\nwe assess their performance by directly asking them ques-\ntions. However, we found that most LLMs struggle to an-\nswer them correctly. To ensure a more reasonable evalua-\ntion, we only consider LLMs that have an accuracy rate of\nover 70% as this threshold is relatively high and encom-\npasses more LLMs. The results are shown in Table 7. We\npresent the following metrics: accuracy without any docu-\nments, accuracy with counterfactual documents, error de-\ntection rates, and error correction rates. We can see that It\nis hard for LLMs to identify and correct factual errors in the\ndocuments. This suggests that the model can be easily mis-\nled by documents containing incorrect facts.\nIt is important to note that retrieval-augmented generation\nis not designed to automatically address factual errors within\na given context, as this contradicts the underlying assump-\ntion that the model lacks knowledge and relies on retrieved\ndocuments for additional information. However, this issue is\ncrucial in practical applications due to the abundance of fake\nnews on the internet. Existing LLMs do not have a safeguard\nto handle inaccurate responses caused by misinformation. In\nfact, they heavily depend on the information they retrieve.\nEven when LLMs contain the internal knowledge about the\nquestions, they often trust false information that is retrieved.\nThis presents significant a challenge for the future develop-\nment of RAG in LLMs.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we evaluated four abilities of retrieval-\naugmented generation in LLMs: noise robustness, nega-\ntive rejection, information integration, and counterfactual\nrobustness. To conduct the evaluation, we built Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation Benchmark (RGB). The instances of\nRGB are generated from latest news articles and the external\ndocuments obtained from search engines. The experimental\nresults suggest that current LLMs have limitations in the 4\nabilities. This indicates that there is still a significant amount\nof work needed to effectively apply RAG to LLMs. To en-\nsure accurate and reliable responses from LLMs, it is crucial\nto exercise caution and carefully design for RAG.",

MisalignmentError Table 6: Error cases of information integration, the re- sponses are generated by ChatGLM2-6B. The blue and red texts represent the answers to two sub-questions. (1) Merging Error (28% of the total).The model some- times merges the answers of the two sub-questions, resulting in an error. It mistakenly uses the answer from one question to address both two questions. At this point, the model will disregard any documents related to one sub-question. For example, in Table 6, it incorrectly states that Group D is the World Cup group for both France and Germany, while in fact Germany is actually assigned to Group E. (2) Ignoring Error (28% of the total).Sometimes, the model may ignore one of the sub-questions and only answer the other. This error occurs when the model lacks a complete understanding of the problem and fails to recognize that it consists of multiple sub-problems. As a result, the model only considers relevant documents for one sub-problem in order to generate an answer, disregarding the question posed by another sub-problem. For example, in Table 6, the model only provides the answer for the MVP of Super Bowl 2022 and does not consider 2023. (3) Misalignment Error (6% of the total).Sometimes, the model incorrectly identifies the documents for one sub- question as the documents for another sub-question, leading to misaligned answers. For example, in Table 6, the third an- swer has two errors: an ignoring error and a misalignment er- ror. Firstly, the model only mentioned the Best Picture of the 2023 (95th) Academy Awards, completely disregarding the 2022 awards. Additionally, it incorrectly stated that “CODA” is the Best Picture of 2023 when it was actually awarded as the Best Picture in 2022. The errors mentioned above are primarily caused by the limited understanding of complex questions, which hinders the ability to effectively utilize information from different sub-problems. The key lies in improving the model’s rea- soning capability.

How- ever, these methods slow down the inference speed and can- not provide timely responses. Results on Counterfactual Robustness testbed In order to ensure that LLMs possess relevant knowledge, we assess their performance by directly asking them ques- tions. However, we found that most LLMs struggle to an- swer them correctly. To ensure a more reasonable evalua- tion, we only consider LLMs that have an accuracy rate of over 70% as this threshold is relatively high and encom- passes more LLMs. The results are shown in Table 7. We present the following metrics: accuracy without any docu- ments, accuracy with counterfactual documents, error de- tection rates, and error correction rates. We can see that It is hard for LLMs to identify and correct factual errors in the documents. This suggests that the model can be easily mis- led by documents containing incorrect facts. It is important to note that retrieval-augmented generation is not designed to automatically address factual errors within a given context, as this contradicts the underlying assump- tion that the model lacks knowledge and relies on retrieved documents for additional information. However, this issue is crucial in practical applications due to the abundance of fake news on the internet. Existing LLMs do not have a safeguard to handle inaccurate responses caused by misinformation. In fact, they heavily depend on the information they retrieve. Even when LLMs contain the internal knowledge about the questions, they often trust false information that is retrieved. This presents significant a challenge for the future develop- ment of RAG in LLMs.",

To conduct the evaluation, we built Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation Benchmark (RGB). The instances of\nRGB are generated from latest news articles and the external\ndocuments obtained from search engines. The experimental\nresults suggest that current LLMs have limitations in the 4\nabilities. This indicates that there is still a significant amount\nof work needed to effectively apply RAG to LLMs. To en-\nsure accurate and reliable responses from LLMs, it is crucial\nto exercise caution and carefully design for RAG.",

We can see that information integration poses a challenge for RAG in LLMs. Question Answer Response Errors What groupings are France andGermany in World Cup 2022?Group DGroup E France and Germany are inGroup D of the 2022 FIFAWorld Cup.

MisalignmentError Table 6: Error cases of information integration, the re- sponses are generated by ChatGLM2-6B. The blue and red texts represent the answers to two sub-questions. (1) Merging Error (28% of the total).The model some- times merges the answers of the two sub-questions, resulting in an error. It mistakenly uses the answer from one question to address both two questions. At this point, the model will disregard any documents related to one sub-question. For example, in Table 6, it incorrectly states that Group D is the World Cup group for both France and Germany, while in fact Germany is actually assigned to Group E. (2) Ignoring Error (28% of the total).Sometimes, the model may ignore one of the sub-questions and only answer the other. This error occurs when the model lacks a complete understanding of the problem and fails to recognize that it consists of multiple sub-problems. As a result, the model only considers relevant documents for one sub-problem in order to generate an answer, disregarding the question posed by another sub-problem. For example, in Table 6, the model only provides the answer for the MVP of Super Bowl 2022 and does not consider 2023. (3) Misalignment Error (6% of the total).Sometimes, the model incorrectly identifies the documents for one sub- question as the documents for another sub-question, leading to misaligned answers. For example, in Table 6, the third an- swer has two errors: an ignoring error and a misalignment er- ror. Firstly, the model only mentioned the Best Picture of the 2023 (95th) Academy Awards, completely disregarding the 2022 awards. Additionally, it incorrectly stated that “CODA” is the Best Picture of 2023 when it was actually awarded as the Best Picture in 2022. The errors mentioned above are primarily caused by the limited understanding of complex questions, which hinders the ability to effectively utilize information from different sub-problems. The key lies in improving the model’s rea- soning capability.

How- ever, these methods slow down the inference speed and can- not provide timely responses. Results on Counterfactual Robustness testbed In order to ensure that LLMs possess relevant knowledge, we assess their performance by directly asking them ques- tions. However, we found that most LLMs struggle to an- swer them correctly. To ensure a more reasonable evalua- tion, we only consider LLMs that have an accuracy rate of over 70% as this threshold is relatively high and encom- passes more LLMs. The results are shown in Table 7. We present the following metrics: accuracy without any docu- ments, accuracy with counterfactual documents, error de- tection rates, and error correction rates. We can see that It is hard for LLMs to identify and correct factual errors in the documents. This suggests that the model can be easily mis- led by documents containing incorrect facts. It is important to note that retrieval-augmented generation is not designed to automatically address factual errors within a given context, as this contradicts the underlying assump- tion that the model lacks knowledge and relies on retrieved documents for additional information. However, this issue is crucial in practical applications due to the abundance of fake news on the internet. Existing LLMs do not have a safeguard to handle inaccurate responses caused by misinformation. In fact, they heavily depend on the information they retrieve. Even when LLMs contain the internal knowledge about the questions, they often trust false information that is retrieved. This presents significant a challenge for the future develop- ment of RAG in LLMs.",

          "page_content": "LOGGING\nBasic logging in Kubernetes behaves much like logging in Docker. There is a kubectl logs command that \nwill show you all the information written to stdout and stderr for a given container in a pod. If a pod has \nonly one container, there is no need to specify it explicitly, however when a pod has several containers \nwe need to add -c container to the end of the command. As with Docker, we can opt to follow \nlogs, to reduce the number of recent lines with --tail and we can filter them by date. Unlike Docker, \nKubernetes enables us to  check the logs of a container that crashed using the --previous option.\nThe ability to keep the logs of a previous container is available as long as the pod it was run in remains \navailable. When a pod is removed, so are its logs. \nLog rotation is performed by Kubernetes. The default values are daily rotation or 10 MB to avoid log files \ntaking up all the available disk space. Up to five rotations are kept for historical evidence. Remember that \nonly the last rotation is displayed with kubectl logs; if you want to access an earlier one, you must do so \nmanually.\nPer our example with the Hello Minikube service, we can use kubectl logs hello-minikube-\n2433534028-ouxw8 to view the access log containing our curl request.\nAll information so far concerns per-node log files. There are no cluster-level logging capabilities built into \nKubernetes, but there are some common methods that can be implemented for this purpose.\nIn this approach, a logging agent is run on every node, preferably through a DeamonSet replica. A \npopular choice in this space is fluentd. It can be configured with various backends among which are \nGoogle Cloud Platform and Elasticsearch.\nFluentd even goes as far as to provide a ready to use DaemonSet YAML on GitHub. All that needs \nto be done is edit its configuration to point at our logging backend.\nThere are several use cases for this approach. The general idea is that a dedicated logging \ncomponent in each pod either writes logs to its stdout and stderr or delivers the logs directly to a \nlogging backend. With such a sidecar approach, we can aggregate all logs from different containers \nin a pod to a single stream that can be accessed with kubectl logs or we can split logs of one \napplication into different logical streams. For example, Webservers’ access.log and error.log can each  \nbe streamed by a dedicated container to its stdout, so we can check them separately with kubectl \nlogs $podname -c access-log and kubectl logs $podname -c error-log.\nIf the application running in a pod can already communicate with a logging backend, it is possible to \nskip the Kubernetes logging options altogether. While direct logging may offer some performance \nadvantages and provide slightly better security (all data stored in just one place), it also prevents us \nfrom using kubectl logs. In most cases, this approach is discouraged.\nDEDICATED AGENT RUNNING ON EVERY NODE\nDEDICATED CONTAINER INSIDE A POD\nDIRECT LOGGING FROM AN APPLICATION\nStratoscale\n18\nEverything Kubernetes: A Practical Guide",

          "page_content": "LOGGING\nBasic logging in Kubernetes behaves much like logging in Docker. There is a kubectl logs command that \nwill show you all the information written to stdout and stderr for a given container in a pod. If a pod has \nonly one container, there is no need to specify it explicitly, however when a pod has several containers \nwe need to add -c container to the end of the command. As with Docker, we can opt to follow \nlogs, to reduce the number of recent lines with --tail and we can filter them by date. Unlike Docker, \nKubernetes enables us to  check the logs of a container that crashed using the --previous option.\nThe ability to keep the logs of a previous container is available as long as the pod it was run in remains \navailable. When a pod is removed, so are its logs. \nLog rotation is performed by Kubernetes. The default values are daily rotation or 10 MB to avoid log files \ntaking up all the available disk space. Up to five rotations are kept for historical evidence. Remember that \nonly the last rotation is displayed with kubectl logs; if you want to access an earlier one, you must do so \nmanually.\nPer our example with the Hello Minikube service, we can use kubectl logs hello-minikube-\n2433534028-ouxw8 to view the access log containing our curl request.\nAll information so far concerns per-node log files. There are no cluster-level logging capabilities built into \nKubernetes, but there are some common methods that can be implemented for this purpose.\nIn this approach, a logging agent is run on every node, preferably through a DeamonSet replica. A \npopular choice in this space is fluentd. It can be configured with various backends among which are \nGoogle Cloud Platform and Elasticsearch.\nFluentd even goes as far as to provide a ready to use DaemonSet YAML on GitHub. All that needs \nto be done is edit its configuration to point at our logging backend.\nThere are several use cases for this approach. The general idea is that a dedicated logging \ncomponent in each pod either writes logs to its stdout and stderr or delivers the logs directly to a \nlogging backend. With such a sidecar approach, we can aggregate all logs from different containers \nin a pod to a single stream that can be accessed with kubectl logs or we can split logs of one \napplication into different logical streams. For example, Webservers’ access.log and error.log can each  \nbe streamed by a dedicated container to its stdout, so we can check them separately with kubectl \nlogs $podname -c access-log and kubectl logs $podname -c error-log.\nIf the application running in a pod can already communicate with a logging backend, it is possible to \nskip the Kubernetes logging options altogether. While direct logging may offer some performance \nadvantages and provide slightly better security (all data stored in just one place), it also prevents us \nfrom using kubectl logs. In most cases, this approach is discouraged.\nDEDICATED AGENT RUNNING ON EVERY NODE\nDEDICATED CONTAINER INSIDE A POD\nDIRECT LOGGING FROM AN APPLICATION\nStratoscale\n18\nEverything Kubernetes: A Practical Guide",

There is a kubectl logs command that will show you all the information written to stdout and stderr for a given container in a pod. If a pod has only one container, there is no need to specify it explicitly, however when a pod has several containers we need to add -c container to the end of the command. As with Docker, we can opt to follow logs, to reduce the number of recent lines with --tail and we can filter them by date. Unlike Docker, Kubernetes enables us to check the logs of a container that crashed using the --previous option. The ability to keep the logs of a previous container is available as long as the pod it was run in remains available. When a pod is removed, so are its logs. Log rotation is performed by Kubernetes. The default values are daily rotation or 10 MB to avoid log files taking up all the available disk space. Up to five rotations are kept for historical evidence. Remember that only the last rotation is displayed with kubectl logs; if you want to access an earlier one, you must do so manually. Per our example with the Hello Minikube service, we can use kubectl logs hello-minikube- 2433534028-ouxw8 to view the access log containing our curl request. All information so far concerns per-node log files. There are no cluster-level logging capabilities built into Kubernetes, but there are some common methods that can be implemented for this purpose. In this approach, a logging agent is run on every node, preferably through a DeamonSet replica. A popular choice in this space is fluentd. It can be configured with various backends among which are Google Cloud Platform and Elasticsearch. Fluentd even goes as far as to provide a ready to use DaemonSet YAML on GitHub. All that needs to be done is edit its configuration to point at our logging backend. There are several use cases for this approach. The general idea is that a dedicated logging component in each pod either writes logs to its stdout and stderr or delivers the logs directly to a logging backend. With such a sidecar approach, we can aggregate all logs from different containers in a pod to a single stream that can be accessed with kubectl logs or we can split logs of one application into different logical streams. For example, Webservers’ access.log and error.log can each be streamed by a dedicated container to its stdout, so we can check them separately with kubectl logs $podname -c access-log and kubectl logs $podname -c error-log. If the application running in a pod can already communicate with a logging backend, it is possible to skip the Kubernetes logging options altogether. While direct logging may offer some performance advantages and provide slightly better security (all data stored in just one place), it also prevents us from using kubectl logs.

RAG\nsystems are composed of a retrieval and an\nLLM based generation module, and provide\nLLMs with knowledge from a reference textual\ndatabase, which enables them to act as a natu-\nral language layer between a user and textual\ndatabases, reducing the risk of hallucinations.\nEvaluating RAG architectures is, however, chal-\nlenging because there are several dimensions to\nconsider: the ability of the retrieval system to\nidentify relevant and focused context passages,\nthe ability of the LLM to exploit such passages\nin a faithful way, or the quality of the gener-\nation itself. With RAGA S, we put forward a\nsuite of metrics which can be used to evaluate\nthese different dimensions without having to\nrely on ground truth human annotations. We\nposit that such a framework can crucially con-\ntribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG archi-\ntectures, which is especially important given\nthe fast adoption of LLMs.\n1 Introduction\nLanguage Models (LMs) capture a vast amount\nof knowledge about the world, which allows them\nto answer questions without accessing any exter-\nnal sources. This idea of LMs as repositories of\nknowledge emerged shortly after the introduction\nof BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more\nfirmly established with the introduction of ever\nlarger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most\nrecent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture\nenough knowledge to rival human performance\nacross a wide variety of question answering bench-\nmarks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using\nLLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen-\ntal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer\nquestions about events that have happened after\nthey were trained. Second, even the largest models\nstruggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely\nmentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al.,\n2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution\nto these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al.,\n2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question\nthen essentially involves retrieving relevant pas-\nsages from a corpus and feeding these passages,\nalong with the original question, to the LM. While\ninitial approaches relied on specialised LMs for\nretrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel-\nwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work\nhas suggested that simply adding retrieved docu-\nments to the input of a standard LM can also work\nwell (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi\net al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval-\naugmented strategies in combination with LLMs\nthat are only available through APIs.\nWhile the usefulness of retrieval-augmented\nstrategies is clear, their implementation requires\na significant amount of tuning, as the overall per-\nformance will be affected by the retrieval model,\nthe considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for-\nmulation, among others. Automated evaluation of\nretrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In\npractice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms\nof the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea-\nsuring perplexity on some reference corpus. How-\never, such evaluations are not always predictive\nof downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c).\nMoreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM\nprobabilities, which are not accessible for some\nclosed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques-\ntion answering is another common evaluation task,\nbut usually only datasets with short extractive an-\nswers are considered, which may not be represen-\ntative of how the system will be used.\nTo address these issues, in this paper we present\nRAGA S1, a framework for the automated assess-\n1RAGA S is available at https://github.com/\nexplodinggradients/ragas.\narXiv:2309.15217v1  [cs.CL]  26 Sep 2023",

RAG systems combine retrieval and LLM-based generation modules. Evaluating RAG architectures is challenging due to various dimensions, including retrieval system performance and LLM exploitation. RAGA S provides a suite of metrics for evaluating these dimensions without human annotations. This framework can contribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures, which is important given the fast adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current evaluation methods have limitations, such as relying on ground truth human annotations and being non-predictive of downstream performance.

We\nposit that such a framework can crucially con-\ntribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG archi-\ntectures, which is especially important given\nthe fast adoption of LLMs.\n1 Introduction\nLanguage Models (LMs) capture a vast amount\nof knowledge about the world, which allows them\nto answer questions without accessing any exter-\nnal sources. This idea of LMs as repositories of\nknowledge emerged shortly after the introduction\nof BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more\nfirmly established with the introduction of ever\nlarger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most\nrecent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture\nenough knowledge to rival human performance\nacross a wide variety of question answering bench-\nmarks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using\nLLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen-\ntal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer\nquestions about events that have happened after\nthey were trained. Second, even the largest models\nstruggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely\nmentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al.,\n2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution\nto these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al.,\n2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question\nthen essentially involves retrieving relevant pas-\nsages from a corpus and feeding these passages,\nalong with the original question, to the LM. While\ninitial approaches relied on specialised LMs for\nretrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel-\nwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work\nhas suggested that simply adding retrieved docu-\nments to the input of a standard LM can also work\nwell (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi\net al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval-\naugmented strategies in combination with LLMs\nthat are only available through APIs.\nWhile the usefulness of retrieval-augmented\nstrategies is clear, their implementation requires\na significant amount of tuning, as the overall per-\nformance will be affected by the retrieval model,\nthe considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for-\nmulation, among others. Automated evaluation of\nretrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In\npractice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms\nof the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea-\nsuring perplexity on some reference corpus. How-\never, such evaluations are not always predictive\nof downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c).\nMoreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM\nprobabilities, which are not accessible for some\nclosed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques-\ntion answering is another common evaluation task,\nbut usually only datasets with short extractive an-\nswers are considered, which may not be represen-\ntative of how the system will be used.\nTo address these issues, in this paper we present\nRAGA S1, a framework for the automated assess-\n1RAGA S is available at https://github.com/\nexplodinggradients/ragas.\narXiv:2309.15217v1  [cs.CL]  26 Sep 2023",

RAG systems combine retrieval and LLM-based generation modules. Evaluating RAG architectures is challenging due to various dimensions, including retrieval system performance and LLM exploitation. RAGA S provides a suite of metrics for evaluating these dimensions without human annotations. This framework can contribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures, which is important given the fast adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current evaluation methods have limitations, such as relying on ground truth human annotations and being non-predictive of downstream performance. The paper presents a solution using RAGA S, an automated assessment framework for retrieval-augmented systems.",

RAG systems are composed of a retrieval and an LLM based generation module, and provide LLMs with knowledge from a reference textual database, which enables them to act as a natu- ral language layer between a user and textual databases, reducing the risk of hallucinations. Evaluating RAG architectures is, however, chal- lenging because there are several dimensions to consider: the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages in a faithful way, or the quality of the gener- ation itself. With RAGA S, we put forward a suite of metrics which can be used to evaluate these different dimensions without having to rely on ground truth human annotations. We posit that such a framework can crucially con- tribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG archi- tectures, which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs. 1 Introduction Language Models (LMs) capture a vast amount of knowledge about the world, which allows them to answer questions without accessing any exter- nal sources. This idea of LMs as repositories of knowledge emerged shortly after the introduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more firmly established with the introduction of ever larger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most recent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture enough knowledge to rival human performance across a wide variety of question answering bench- marks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using LLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen- tal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer questions about events that have happened after they were trained. Second, even the largest models struggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely mentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution to these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question then essentially involves retrieving relevant pas- sages from a corpus and feeding these passages, along with the original question, to the LM. While initial approaches relied on specialised LMs for retrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel- wal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work has suggested that simply adding retrieved docu- ments to the input of a standard LM can also work well (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval- augmented strategies in combination with LLMs that are only available through APIs. While the usefulness of retrieval-augmented strategies is clear, their implementation requires a significant amount of tuning, as the overall per- formance will be affected by the retrieval model, the considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for- mulation, among others. Automated evaluation of retrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In practice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms of the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea- suring perplexity on some reference corpus. How- ever, such evaluations are not always predictive of downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c). Moreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM probabilities, which are not accessible for some closed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques- tion answering is another common evaluation task, but usually only datasets with short extractive an- swers are considered, which may not be represen- tative of how the system will be used. To address these issues, in this paper we present RAGA S1, a framework for the automated assess- 1RAGA S is available at https://github.com/ explodinggradients/ragas. arXiv:2309.15217v1 [cs.CL] 26 Sep 2023",

This idea of LMs as repositories of knowledge emerged shortly after the introduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more firmly established with the introduction of ever larger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most recent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture enough knowledge to rival human performance across a wide variety of question answering bench- marks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using LLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen- tal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer questions about events that have happened after they were trained. Second, even the largest models struggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely mentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution to these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question then essentially involves retrieving relevant pas- sages from a corpus and feeding these passages, along with the original question, to the LM. While initial approaches relied on specialised LMs for retrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel- wal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work has suggested that simply adding retrieved docu- ments to the input of a standard LM can also work well (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval- augmented strategies in combination with LLMs that are only available through APIs. While the usefulness of retrieval-augmented strategies is clear, their implementation requires a significant amount of tuning, as the overall per- formance will be affected by the retrieval model, the considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for- mulation, among others. Automated evaluation of retrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In practice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms of the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea- suring perplexity on some reference corpus. How- ever, such evaluations are not always predictive of downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c). Moreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM probabilities, which are not accessible for some closed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques- tion answering is another common evaluation task, but usually only datasets with short extractive an- swers are considered, which may not be represen- tative of how the system will be used. To address these issues, in this paper we present RAGA S1, a framework for the automated assess- 1RAGA S is available at https://github.com/ explodinggradients/ragas. arXiv:2309.15217v1 [cs.CL] 26 Sep 2023",

          "page_content": "ment of retrieval augmented generation systems.\nWe focus on settings where reference answers may\nnot be available, and where we want to estimate\ndifferent proxies for correctness, in addition to the\nusefulness of the retrieved passages. The RAGA S\nframework provides an integration with both llama-\nindex and Langchain, the most widely used frame-\nworks for building RAG solutions, thus enabling\ndevelopers to easily integrate RAGA S into their\nstandard workflow.\n2 Related Work\nEstimating faithfulness using LLMsThe prob-\nlem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated\nresponses has been extensively studied (Ji et al.,\n2023). Several authors have suggested the idea\nof predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt-\ning strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy-\nses, however, suggest that existing models struggle\nwith detecting hallucination when using standard\nprompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and\nMitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking\nthe generated responses to facts from an external\nknowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not\nalways possible.\nYet another strategy is to inspect the probabili-\nties assigned to individual tokens, where we would\nexpect the model to be less confident in halluci-\nnated answers than in factual ones. For instance,\nBARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality\nby looking at the conditional probability of the gen-\nerated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022)\nuse a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob-\nservation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba-\nbilities when answering multiple-choice questions,\nthey essentially convert the problem of validating\nmodel generated answers into a multiple-choice\nquestion which asks whether the answer is true or\nfalse. Rather than looking at the output probabil-\nities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train\na supervised classifier on the weights from one of\nthe hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a\ngiven statement is true or not. While the approach\nperforms well, the need to access the hidden states\nof the model makes it unsuitable for systems that\naccess LLMs through an API.\nFor models that do not provide access to token\nprobabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, differ-\nent methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul\net al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sam-\npling multiple answers. Their core idea is that\nfactual answers are more stable: when an answer is\nfactual, we can expect that different samples will\ntend to be semantically similar, whereas this is less\nlikely to be the case for hallucinated answers.\nAutomated evaluation of text generation systems\nLLMs have also been leveraged to automatically\nevaluate other aspects of generated text fragments,\nbeyond factuality. For instance, GPTScore (Fu\net al., 2023) uses a prompt that specifies the consid-\nered aspect (e.g. fluency) and then scores passages\nbased on the average probability of the generated\ntokens, according to a given autoregressive LM.\nThis idea of using prompts was previously also\nconsidered by Yuan et al. (2021), although they\nused a smaller fine-tuned LM (i.e. BART) and did\nnot observe a clear benefit from using prompts. An-\nother approach directly asks ChatGPT to evaluate\na particular aspect of the given answer by provid-\ning a score between 0 and 100, or by providing a\nrating on a 5-star scale (Wang et al., 2023a). Re-\nmarkably, strong results can be obtained in this\nway, although it comes with the limitation of being\nsensitive to the design of the prompt. Rather than\nscoring individual answers, some authors have also\nfocused on using an LLM to select the best answer\namong a number of candidates (Wang et al., 2023b),\ntypically to compare the performance of different\nLLMs. However, care is needed with this approach,\nas the order in which the answers is presented can\ninfluence the result (Wang et al., 2023b).\nIn terms of how ground truth answers or, more\ngenerally, generations, have been typically used\nin the literature, most approaches have relied on\nthe availability of one or more reference answers.\nFor instance, BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020)\nand MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) use contex-\ntualised embeddings, produced by a pre-trained\nBERT model, to compare the similarity between\nthe generated answer and the reference answers.\nBARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) similarly uses refer-\nence answers to compute aspects such as precision\n(estimated as the probability of generating the gen-\nerated answer given the reference) and recall (esti-\nmated as the probability of generating the reference\ngiven the generated answer).\n3 Evaluation Strategies\nWe consider a standard RAG setting, where given a\nquestion q, the system first retrieves some context\nc(q) and then uses the retrieved context to generate\nan answer as(q).

We focus on settings where reference answers may not be available, and where we want to estimate different proxies for correctness, in addition to the usefulness of the retrieved passages. The RAGA S framework provides an integration with both llama- index and Langchain, the most widely used frame- works for building RAG solutions, thus enabling developers to easily integrate RAGA S into their standard workflow. 2 Related Work Estimating faithfulness using LLMsThe prob- lem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated responses has been extensively studied (Ji et al., 2023). Several authors have suggested the idea of predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt- ing strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy- ses, however, suggest that existing models struggle with detecting hallucination when using standard prompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and Mitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking the generated responses to facts from an external knowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not always possible. Yet another strategy is to inspect the probabili- ties assigned to individual tokens, where we would expect the model to be less confident in halluci- nated answers than in factual ones. For instance, BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality by looking at the conditional probability of the gen- erated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022) use a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob- servation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba- bilities when answering multiple-choice questions, they essentially convert the problem of validating model generated answers into a multiple-choice question which asks whether the answer is true or false. Rather than looking at the output probabil- ities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train a supervised classifier on the weights from one of the hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a given statement is true or not. While the approach performs well, the need to access the hidden states of the model makes it unsuitable for systems that access LLMs through an API. For models that do not provide access to token probabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, differ- ent methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sam- pling multiple answers. Their core idea is that factual answers are more stable: when an answer is factual, we can expect that different samples will tend to be semantically similar, whereas this is less likely to be the case for hallucinated answers. Automated evaluation of text generation systems LLMs have also been leveraged to automatically evaluate other aspects of generated text fragments, beyond factuality. For instance, GPTScore (Fu et al., 2023) uses a prompt that specifies the consid- ered aspect (e.g. fluency) and then scores passages based on the average probability of the generated tokens, according to a given autoregressive LM. This idea of using prompts was previously also considered by Yuan et al. (2021), although they used a smaller fine-tuned LM (i.e. BART) and did not observe a clear benefit from using prompts. An- other approach directly asks ChatGPT to evaluate a particular aspect of the given answer by provid- ing a score between 0 and 100, or by providing a rating on a 5-star scale (Wang et al., 2023a). Re- markably, strong results can be obtained in this way, although it comes with the limitation of being sensitive to the design of the prompt. Rather than scoring individual answers, some authors have also focused on using an LLM to select the best answer among a number of candidates (Wang et al., 2023b), typically to compare the performance of different LLMs. However, care is needed with this approach, as the order in which the answers is presented can influence the result (Wang et al., 2023b). In terms of how ground truth answers or, more generally, generations, have been typically used in the literature, most approaches have relied on the availability of one or more reference answers. For instance, BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) use contex- tualised embeddings, produced by a pre-trained BERT model, to compare the similarity between the generated answer and the reference answers. BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) similarly uses refer- ence answers to compute aspects such as precision (estimated as the probability of generating the gen- erated answer given the reference) and recall (esti- mated as the probability of generating the reference given the generated answer).",

The RAGA S\nframework provides an integration with both llama-\nindex and Langchain, the most widely used frame-\nworks for building RAG solutions, thus enabling\ndevelopers to easily integrate RAGA S into their\nstandard workflow.\n2 Related Work\nEstimating faithfulness using LLMsThe prob-\nlem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated\nresponses has been extensively studied (Ji et al.,\n2023). Several authors have suggested the idea\nof predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt-\ning strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy-\nses, however, suggest that existing models struggle\nwith detecting hallucination when using standard\nprompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and\nMitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking\nthe generated responses to facts from an external\nknowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not\nalways possible.\nYet another strategy is to inspect the probabili-\nties assigned to individual tokens, where we would\nexpect the model to be less confident in halluci-\nnated answers than in factual ones. For instance,\nBARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality\nby looking at the conditional probability of the gen-\nerated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022)\nuse a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob-\nservation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba-\nbilities when answering multiple-choice questions,\nthey essentially convert the problem of validating\nmodel generated answers into a multiple-choice\nquestion which asks whether the answer is true or\nfalse. Rather than looking at the output probabil-\nities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train\na supervised classifier on the weights from one of\nthe hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a\ngiven statement is true or not. While the approach\nperforms well, the need to access the hidden states\nof the model makes it unsuitable for systems that\naccess LLMs through an API.\nFor models that do not provide access to token\nprobabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, differ-\nent methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul\net al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sam-\npling multiple answers. Their core idea is that\nfactual answers are more stable: when an answer is\nfactual, we can expect that different samples will\ntend to be semantically similar, whereas this is less\nlikely to be the case for hallucinated answers.\nAutomated evaluation of text generation systems\nLLMs have also been leveraged to automatically\nevaluate other aspects of generated text fragments,\nbeyond factuality. For instance, GPTScore (Fu\net al., 2023) uses a prompt that specifies the consid-\nered aspect (e.g. fluency) and then scores passages\nbased on the average probability of the generated\ntokens, according to a given autoregressive LM.\nThis idea of using prompts was previously also\nconsidered by Yuan et al. (2021), although they\nused a smaller fine-tuned LM (i.e. BART) and did\nnot observe a clear benefit from using prompts. An-\nother approach directly asks ChatGPT to evaluate\na particular aspect of the given answer by provid-\ning a score between 0 and 100, or by providing a\nrating on a 5-star scale (Wang et al., 2023a). Re-\nmarkably, strong results can be obtained in this\nway, although it comes with the limitation of being\nsensitive to the design of the prompt. Rather than\nscoring individual answers, some authors have also\nfocused on using an LLM to select the best answer\namong a number of candidates (Wang et al., 2023b),\ntypically to compare the performance of different\nLLMs. However, care is needed with this approach,\nas the order in which the answers is presented can\ninfluence the result (Wang et al., 2023b).\nIn terms of how ground truth answers or, more\ngenerally, generations, have been typically used\nin the literature, most approaches have relied on\nthe availability of one or more reference answers.\nFor instance, BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020)\nand MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) use contex-\ntualised embeddings, produced by a pre-trained\nBERT model, to compare the similarity between\nthe generated answer and the reference answers.\nBARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) similarly uses refer-\nence answers to compute aspects such as precision\n(estimated as the probability of generating the gen-\nerated answer given the reference) and recall (esti-\nmated as the probability of generating the reference\ngiven the generated answer).\n3 Evaluation Strategies\nWe consider a standard RAG setting, where given a\nquestion q, the system first retrieves some context\nc(q) and then uses the retrieved context to generate\nan answer as(q).

We focus on settings where reference answers may not be available, and where we want to estimate different proxies for correctness, in addition to the usefulness of the retrieved passages. The RAGA S framework provides an integration with both llama- index and Langchain, the most widely used frame- works for building RAG solutions, thus enabling developers to easily integrate RAGA S into their standard workflow. 2 Related Work Estimating faithfulness using LLMsThe prob- lem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated responses has been extensively studied (Ji et al., 2023). Several authors have suggested the idea of predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt- ing strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy- ses, however, suggest that existing models struggle with detecting hallucination when using standard prompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and Mitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking the generated responses to facts from an external knowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not always possible. Yet another strategy is to inspect the probabili- ties assigned to individual tokens, where we would expect the model to be less confident in halluci- nated answers than in factual ones. For instance, BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality by looking at the conditional probability of the gen- erated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022) use a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob- servation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba- bilities when answering multiple-choice questions, they essentially convert the problem of validating model generated answers into a multiple-choice question which asks whether the answer is true or false. Rather than looking at the output probabil- ities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train a supervised classifier on the weights from one of the hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a given statement is true or not. While the approach performs well, the need to access the hidden states of the model makes it unsuitable for systems that access LLMs through an API. For models that do not provide access to token probabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, differ- ent methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sam- pling multiple answers. Their core idea is that factual answers are more stable: when an answer is factual, we can expect that different samples will tend to be semantically similar, whereas this is less likely to be the case for hallucinated answers. Automated evaluation of text generation systems LLMs have also been leveraged to automatically evaluate other aspects of generated text fragments, beyond factuality. For instance, GPTScore (Fu et al., 2023) uses a prompt that specifies the consid- ered aspect (e.g. fluency) and then scores passages based on the average probability of the generated tokens, according to a given autoregressive LM. This idea of using prompts was previously also considered by Yuan et al. (2021), although they used a smaller fine-tuned LM (i.e. BART) and did not observe a clear benefit from using prompts. An- other approach directly asks ChatGPT to evaluate a particular aspect of the given answer by provid- ing a score between 0 and 100, or by providing a rating on a 5-star scale (Wang et al., 2023a). Re- markably, strong results can be obtained in this way, although it comes with the limitation of being sensitive to the design of the prompt. Rather than scoring individual answers, some authors have also focused on using an LLM to select the best answer among a number of candidates (Wang et al., 2023b), typically to compare the performance of different LLMs. However, care is needed with this approach, as the order in which the answers is presented can influence the result (Wang et al., 2023b). In terms of how ground truth answers or, more generally, generations, have been typically used in the literature, most approaches have relied on the availability of one or more reference answers. For instance, BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) use contex- tualised embeddings, produced by a pre-trained BERT model, to compare the similarity between the generated answer and the reference answers. BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) similarly uses refer- ence answers to compute aspects such as precision (estimated as the probability of generating the gen- erated answer given the reference) and recall (esti- mated as the probability of generating the reference given the generated answer).",

Since we are not aware of any publicly available datasets that could be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset, which we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov- ering events that have happened since the start of 20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages, we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that can be answered based on the introductory section of the page, using the following prompt: Your task is to formulate a question from given context satisfying the rules given below: 1. The question should be fully answered from the given context. 2. The question should be framed from a part that contains non-trivial informa- tion. 3.

Both annotators were fluent in English and were given clear instructions about the meaning of the three considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements were resolved after a discussion between the anno- tators. Faithfulness To obtain human judgements about faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the question without access to any additional context. We then asked the annotators to judge which of the two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard one or the one generated without context), given the question and corresponding Wikipedia page. Answer relevance We first used ChatGPT to obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel- evance, using the following prompt: Answer the given question in an incom- plete manner. question: [question] We then asked human annotators to compare this answer, and indicate which of the two answers had the highest answer relevance.",

To estimate context relevance, given a question q and its con- text c(q), the LLM extracts a subset of sentences, Sext, from c(q) that are crucial to answer q, using the following prompt: Please extract relevant sentences from the provided context that can potentially help answer the following question. If no relevant sentences are found, or if you believe the question cannot be answered from the given context, return the phrase \"Insufficient Information\". While extract- ing candidate sentences you’re not al- lowed to make any changes to sentences from given context. The context relevance score is then computed as: CR = number of extracted sentences total number of sentences in c(q) (2) 4 The WikiEval Dataset To evaluate the proposed framework, we ideally need examples of question-context-answer triples which are annotated with human judgments. We can then verify to what extent our metrics agree with human assessments of faithfulness, answer relevance and context relevance. Since we are not aware of any publicly available datasets that could be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset, which we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov- ering events that have happened since the start of 20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages, we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that can be answered based on the introductory section of the page, using the following prompt: Your task is to formulate a question from given context satisfying the rules given below: 1.

The question should be of moderate difficulty. 5. The question must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans. 6. Do not use phrases that ’provided con- text’, etc in the question context: We also used ChatGPT to answer the generated question, when given the corresponding introduc- tory section as context, using the following prompt: Answer the question using the informa- tion from the given context. question: [question] context: [context] All questions were annotated along the three con- sidered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both annotators were fluent in English and were given clear instructions about the meaning of the three considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements were resolved after a discussion between the anno- tators. Faithfulness To obtain human judgements about faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the question without access to any additional context. We then asked the annotators to judge which of the two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard one or the one generated without context), given the question and corresponding Wikipedia page. Answer relevance We first used ChatGPT to obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel- evance, using the following prompt: Answer the given question in an incom- plete manner. question: [question] We then asked human annotators to compare this answer, and indicate which of the two answers had the highest answer relevance.",
