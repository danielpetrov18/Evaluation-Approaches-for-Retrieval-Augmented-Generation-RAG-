    "\n",
    "This object can be used to generate **Golden** instances, which consist out of **input**, **expected output** and **context**. It uses a LLM to come up with random input and thereafter tries to enhance those, by making them more complex and realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a comprehensive guide on understanding how this object works please refer here: [Synthesizer](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms)\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to summarize the most important information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It uses a **LLM to come-up with a comprehensive dataset** much faster than a human can\n",
    "* The process starts with the LLM generating **synthetic queries** based on context from a knowledge base - usually documents\n",
    "* Those initial queries are then **evolved** to reflect real-life complexity and then together with the context can be used to generate a **target/expected output**\n",

    "\n",
    "* There exist two main methods:\n",
    "    - Self-improvement: Iteratively uses the LLMs output to generate more complex queries\n",
    "    - Distillation: A stronger model is being utilized \n",
    "\n",
    "* Constructing contexts:\n",
    "    - During this phase documents from the knowledge base are split using a token splitter\n",
    "    - A random chunk is selected\n",
    "    - Finally, additional chunks are retrieved based on **semantic similarity**, **knowledge graphs** or others\n",
    "    - Ensuring that **chunk size**, **chunk overlap** or other similar parameters here and in the **retrieval component** of the **RAG** application are identical will yield better results\n",
