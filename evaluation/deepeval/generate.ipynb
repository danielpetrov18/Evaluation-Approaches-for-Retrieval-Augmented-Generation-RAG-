      "(' addressed [175].\\n\\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted by the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like LangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity with the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG- related APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The emerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as LangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized products. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code approach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including RAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other technologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are also gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field. In addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and cloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include RAG-centric services. Weaviate’s Verba 11 is designed for personal assistant applications, while Amazon’s Kendra 12 offers intelligent enterprise search services, enabling users to browse various content repositories using built-in connectors. there is a clear In the development of RAG technology, trend towards different specialization directions, such as: 1) Customization - tailoring RAG to meet specific requirements. 2) Simplification - making RAG easier to use to reduce the\\n\\n10https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize\\n\\n11https://github.com/weaviate/Verba 12https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/\\n\\n15\\n\\nFig. 6.

In turn, enhancements to the technology stack drive the development of RAG capabilities. RAG toolkits are converging into a foundational laying the groundwork for advanced enterprise applications. However, a fully integrated, comprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring further innovation and development.\\n\\ntechnology stack,\\n\\nF. Multi-modal RAG\\n\\ntext-based question- answering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data. This expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models that integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\\n\\nRAG has\\n\\ntranscended its\\n\\ninitial\\n\\nImage. RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal model of both retrieving and generating text and images. BLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside LLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero- shot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You Write” method [178] employs image generation to steer the LM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text generation tasks.\\n\\nAudio and Video. The GSS method retrieves and stitches together audio clips to convert machine-translated data into speech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad- vancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by incorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con- version [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever- ages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed- dings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation.\\n\\nVid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal markers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and textual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181].\\n\\nCode. RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by retrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives through encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has demonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera- tion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK method [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query from a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints within the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph question-answering tasks.\\n\\nVIII. CONCLUSION\\n\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha- sizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa- bilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from language models with extensive non-parameterized data from external knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution of RAG technologies and their application on many different tasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms within the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu- lar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over its predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, has further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in RAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve its robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.

      "(' addressed [175].\\n\\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted by the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like LangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity with the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG- related APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The emerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as LangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized products. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code approach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including RAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other technologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are also gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field. In addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and cloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include RAG-centric services. Weaviate’s Verba 11 is designed for personal assistant applications, while Amazon’s Kendra 12 offers intelligent enterprise search services, enabling users to browse various content repositories using built-in connectors. there is a clear In the development of RAG technology, trend towards different specialization directions, such as: 1) Customization - tailoring RAG to meet specific requirements. 2) Simplification - making RAG easier to use to reduce the\\n\\n10https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize\\n\\n11https://github.com/weaviate/Verba 12https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/\\n\\n15\\n\\nFig. 6.

In turn, enhancements to the technology stack drive the development of RAG capabilities. RAG toolkits are converging into a foundational laying the groundwork for advanced enterprise applications. However, a fully integrated, comprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring further innovation and development.\\n\\ntechnology stack,\\n\\nF. Multi-modal RAG\\n\\ntext-based question- answering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data. This expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models that integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\\n\\nRAG has\\n\\ntranscended its\\n\\ninitial\\n\\nImage. RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal model of both retrieving and generating text and images. BLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside LLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero- shot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You Write” method [178] employs image generation to steer the LM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text generation tasks.\\n\\nAudio and Video. The GSS method retrieves and stitches together audio clips to convert machine-translated data into speech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad- vancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by incorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con- version [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever- ages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed- dings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation.\\n\\nVid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal markers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and textual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181].\\n\\nCode. RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by retrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives through encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has demonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera- tion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK method [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query from a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints within the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph question-answering tasks.\\n\\nVIII. CONCLUSION\\n\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha- sizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa- bilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from language models with extensive non-parameterized data from external knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution of RAG technologies and their application on many different tasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms within the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu- lar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over its predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, has further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in RAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve its robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts. RAG’s application scope is expanding into multimodal do- mains, adapting',)\n",
