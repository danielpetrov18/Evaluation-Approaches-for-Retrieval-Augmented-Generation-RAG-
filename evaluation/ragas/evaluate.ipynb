    "### Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Applications: Importance and Impact  \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating RAG-based applications is crucial to ensure the reliability, relevance, and efficiency of their responses. Unlike using LLMs by themselves, RAG-based applications combine the power of Large-Language-Models with vector stores and retrieval components, which introduces complexity. Hence, evaluation of different components in RAG pipelines is crucial. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Pitfalls in RAG Applications\n",
    "- **Hallucination**: Even with retrieved context, LLMs can still generate inaccurate or misleading responses.  \n",
    "- **Irrelevant Retrieval**: Poor retrieval results in the model relying on incomplete or incorrect context.  \n",
    "- **Latency & Efficiency**: Combining retrieval and generation can introduce delays, requiring performance optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Proper Evaluation\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy**: Ensures the factual correctness of responses by using a knowledge base.  \n",
    "- **Enhanced Relevance**: Helps refine retrieval mechanisms, ensuring responses are more context-aware.  \n",
    "- **Robustness & Adaptability**: Identifies failure points, enabling continuous improvements to model behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on Future Development  \n",
    "A structured evaluation process enables better benchmarking, allowing for iterative improvements in retrieval models, embeddings, and LLM fine-tuning. It also promotes transparency in AI decision-making, paving the way for more explainable and ethical AI systems and thus gaining a wider adoption. \n",

    "### **Answer Correctness**\n",
    "\n",
    "### TL;DR:  \n",
    "> **How well does a model’s response align with the ground truth in terms of factual correctness and completeness?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**:  \n",
    "**Answer Correctness** evaluates how accurately a model-generated response corresponds to a given ground truth. It does this by breaking down both texts into discrete factual statements and determining whether these statements match. The metric assesses correctness through a combination of **factual alignment** and **semantic similarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correctness score ranges from **0 to 1**, where higher values indicate better alignment with the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Statement Breakdown and Classification**:  \n",
    "To assess correctness, the response is decomposed into factual statements, which are then categorized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Positives (TP):** Statements in the response that are also in the ground truth.\n",
    "- **False Positives (FP):** Statements in the response that are not supported by the ground truth.\n",
    "- **False Negatives (FN):** Statements in the ground truth that are missing from the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Calculation Formula**:  \n",
    "The **F1 Score** used for Answer Correctness is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F1 = \\frac{|TP|}{|TP| + 0.5 \\times (|FP| + |FN|)} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "- This formula ensures a balance between **precision (avoiding hallucinated facts)** and **recall (retaining key information).**\n",
    "- The **0.5 weight on FP and FN** prevents excessive penalization while ensuring factual accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Computation Steps**:  \n",
    "1. **Extract factual statements** from both the response and the ground truth.  \n",
    "2. **Classify statements** into TP, FP, and FN using a **Correctness Classifier** based on natural language inference (NLI).  \n",
    "3. **Compute factual correctness** using the F1-like score.  \n",
    "4. **Compute semantic similarity** if slight wording variations are acceptable.  \n",
    "5. **Combine both scores** using predefined weight factors (default: factual correctness = 0.75, semantic similarity = 0.25).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Computation Modes**:  \n",

    "> Focuses on exact factual correctness using the TP, FP, and FN classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "F1 = $\\frac{|TP|}{|TP| + 0.5 \\times (|FP| + |FN|)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensures that incorrect statements (FP) and missing information (FN) reduce the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Semantic Similarity Mode**  \n",
    "> Measures overall alignment by incorporating semantic closeness between response and ground truth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **embeddings-based similarity scoring** (e.g., cosine similarity).\n",
    "- Allows for flexible wording but still ensures factual correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Weighted Combination Mode**  \n",
    "> A hybrid approach balancing factual alignment and semantic similarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Score = $ w_1 \\times \\text{Factual Correctness} + w_2 \\times \\text{Semantic Similarity} $\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Controlling Granularity of Statements**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The metric supports **customizing the granularity** of extracted statements using:  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Atomicity:**  \n",
    "- **High Atomicity** → Extracts fine-grained claims from a sentence.  \n",
    "- **Low Atomicity** → Retains larger sentence-level claims.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Coverage:**  \n",
    "- **High Coverage** → Extracts all possible claims from a response.  \n",
    "- **Low Coverage** → Focuses only on the key facts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility ensures adaptability for different evaluation needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Example of Atomicity and Coverage Adjustments**  \n",
    "#### **High Atomicity & High Coverage Example:**\n",
