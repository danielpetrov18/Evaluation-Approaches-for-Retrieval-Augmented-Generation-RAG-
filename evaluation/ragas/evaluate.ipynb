    "### Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Applications: Importance and Impact  \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating RAG-based applications is crucial to ensure the reliability, relevance, and efficiency of their responses. Unlike using LLMs by themselves, RAG-based applications combine the power of Large-Language-Models with vector stores and retrieval components, which introduces complexity. Hence, evaluation of different components in RAG pipelines is crucial. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Pitfalls in RAG Applications\n",
    "- **Hallucination**: Even with retrieved context, LLMs can still generate inaccurate or misleading responses.  \n",
    "- **Irrelevant Retrieval**: Poor retrieval results in the model relying on incomplete or incorrect context.  \n",
    "- **Latency & Efficiency**: Combining retrieval and generation can introduce delays, requiring performance optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Proper Evaluation\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy**: Ensures the factual correctness of responses by using a knowledge base.  \n",
    "- **Enhanced Relevance**: Helps refine retrieval mechanisms, ensuring responses are more context-aware.  \n",
    "- **Robustness & Adaptability**: Identifies failure points, enabling continuous improvements to model behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on Future Development  \n",
    "A structured evaluation process enables better benchmarking, allowing for iterative improvements in retrieval models, embeddings, and LLM fine-tuning. It also promotes transparency in AI decision-making, paving the way for more explainable and ethical AI systems and thus gaining a wider adoption. \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**:  \n",
    "**Answer Correctness** evaluates how accurately a model-generated response corresponds to a given ground truth. It does this by breaking down both texts into discrete factual statements and determining whether these statements match. The metric assesses correctness through a combination of **factual alignment** and **semantic similarity**.\n",

    "To assess correctness, the response is decomposed into factual statements, which are then categorized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Positives (TP):** Statements in the response that are also in the ground truth.\n",
    "- **False Positives (FP):** Statements in the response that are not supported by the ground truth.\n",
