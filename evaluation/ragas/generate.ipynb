    "An evaluation sample is a single structured data instance that is used to assess and measure the performance of your LLM application in specific scenarios. It represents a single unit of interaction or a specific use case that the AI application is expected to handle. In Ragas, evaluation samples are represented using the `SingleTurnSample` and `MultiTurnSample` classes.\n",
