When the airline initiates a schedule change due to operational reasons, they will notify passengers via email, SMS, or push notifications, providing alternative options.

On the other hand, when a passenger requests a flight date change for personal reasons, they must follow specific procedures. They can check the airline's website for available flights on the same route and rebook if necessary. If no suitable alternatives are available, they can request a waiver to change to a more convenient flight or opt for a full refund.

The key differences in handling procedures lie in the notification process and the passenger's flexibility in choosing their new flight options. When the airline initiates a schedule change, passengers have limited control over their new flight options, whereas when requesting a date change, they can explore alternative flights on the same route before deciding on rebooking or a refund.","According to the provided context, Ragas Airlines handles **schedule changes initiated by themselves** and **those requested by passengers** differently. Here's a summary of their procedures:

**Schedule Changes Initiated by Ragas Airlines:**

1. If Ragas Airlines modifies your flight schedule due to operational reasons (e.g., weather conditions or aircraft maintenance), you will be notified via email, SMS, or push notifications.
2. The notification will include the new flight time and date, any changes to your route, and instructions on how to confirm or modify your booking.
3. You can:
	* Accept the new flight by logging into ""Manage My Booking"" and confirming the updated schedule (Option 1).
	* Rebook to a different flight on the same route without extra charges (Option 2).
	* Request a full refund if none of the new options work for you (Option 3).

**Flight Date Changes Initiated by Passengers:**

1. If you need to change your flight date due to personal reasons, log into ""Manage My Booking"" and review your ticket conditions under ""Fare Rules.""
2. The fare type will determine the modification procedure:
	* Refundable tickets can be changed for free or receive a full refund.
	* Non-refundable tickets may require payment of a modification fee or receive a travel credit.
	* Basic Economy/Promo tickets do not allow modifications.
3. To modify your ticket, log into ""Manage My Booking,"" select ""Change Flight,"" choose a new flight date (subject to availability), and pay any applicable fare difference or modification fees.

The key differences in handling procedures are:

1. **Notification process:** Schedule changes initiated by Ragas Airlines will notify passengers via email, SMS, or push notifications, while passenger-initiated changes require the passenger to log into ""Manage My Booking"" to initiate the change.
2. **Modification options:** Ragas Airlines offers more flexibility for schedule changes initiated by themselves, allowing passengers to rebook without extra charges. Passenger-initiated flight date changes are subject to fare type and availability.

These procedures highlight the importance of regularly checking your email and notifications from Ragas Airlines for any updates on your flight schedule.

For **airline-initiated cancellations**, the process involves a notification with new flight options and refund eligibility details. If you choose to rebook, it's free, and if you don't want to travel, you can request a full refund within specified times (7 business days for credit/debit card payments and 20 business days for bank transfers).

For **passenger-initiated cancellations**, the process is more detailed. You must check your fare rules in ""Manage My Booking"" to see if your ticket is refundable or eligible for travel credits. If it's refundable, you can cancel online and receive a full refund credited back to your original payment method. If not, you might be eligible for partial refunds or travel credits.

In terms of **refund processing**, both scenarios involve the airline crediting the refund to your original payment method. However, passenger-initiated cancellations offer more flexibility with fare rules and potential for travel credits if your ticket isn't fully refundable.

**Travel credit storage** is another point of difference. For passenger-initiated cancellations, travel credits are stored in your Ragas Airlines account. In contrast, airline-initiated cancellations don't explicitly mention storing travel credits.

Overall, while both scenarios involve refunds and potential rebooking options, the specifics of fare rules, refund eligibility, and credit storage differ between airline-initiated and passenger-initiated cancellations.","According to the provided context, both airline-initiated and passenger-initiated cancellations involve distinct steps. **Airline-initiated cancellations** follow a notification process where passengers are informed about their new flight options and refund eligibility through email, SMS, or mobile app notifications.

In contrast, **passenger-initiated cancellations**, which occur when a traveler decides to cancel their booking, require passengers to check fare rules in ""Manage My Booking"" to determine refund eligibility. If eligible for a refund, they can choose between receiving it back on their original payment method or opting for travel credit stored in their Ragas Airlines account.

Refund and travel credit processes differ between airline-initiated and passenger-initiated cancellations:

*   **Airline-initiated**: Refunds are processed within 7 business days (credit/debit card payments) to 20 business days (bank transfers). Travel credit is not mentioned as an option in this context.
*   **Passenger-initiated**: Refunds or travel credits can be chosen upon cancellation, with refunds credited back on the original payment method and travel credit stored in the Ragas Airlines account.",,,0.9166666666361111,,0.75,,,,,,,

This process is similar to handling missed connections due to delays, where passengers can rebook on the next available flight at no extra cost by visiting the airline's customer service desk at the airport. However, in both cases, the airline will review your claim and process a refund within 14 business days.

Regarding requesting compensation for delayed flights, the information provided does not specify how to request compensation directly through the website or other channels. It only mentions that passengers may receive compensation depending on the airline's policy, but it does not provide further details on this process.

Therefore, while the procedures for handling missed connections and requesting reimbursement of additional expenses share some similarities, there is limited information available on the standard procedures for requesting compensation directly through the website or other channels.","According to Ragas Airlines' policy, passengers who incur additional expenses due to flight delays can request reimbursement through the ""Claim Compensation"" section on their website.

In contrast, if a passenger misses a connecting flight due to a delay, they should visit the airline's customer service desk at the airport, explain the situation, and the airline will rebook them on the next available flight at no extra cost.
