**Fare Rules for Business Class Tickets:**
- The context does not specify any unique fare rules for business class tickets. It mentions that basic economy and promotional fares have no modifications allowed, but there is no information indicating whether business class has similar restrictions.

**Modification Restrictions:**
- For passengers with non-refundable or non-modifiable tickets (including those without specific exceptions like medical emergencies), they may need to purchase a new ticket if changes are not possible.
- Contacting customer service is recommended for assistance, as they might offer waivers or travel credits in exceptional circumstances.

**Cancellation and Rebooking:**
- If issues arise with the booking, passengers can contact customer service. Refunds or credits are typically available based on fare type, with non-refundable tickets subject to cancellation fees.
- Rebooking may be possible without extra charges if a new flight is found, but this depends on availability.
