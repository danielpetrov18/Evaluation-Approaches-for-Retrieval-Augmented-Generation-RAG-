However, I can provide general information on why airlines might charge fees for cancellations.

Airlines charge cancellation fees because they incur costs when a flight is cancelled, such as crew and aircraft costs that are still incurred even if the flight is not operated. Additionally, airlines often have to rebook passengers on other flights or provide refunds, which also involves administrative costs.

If you don't pay the cancellation fee, your account may be flagged for non-payment, and you may face additional fees or penalties. In some cases, airlines may also cancel your booking entirely if payment is not made.","If non-refundable, you may receive a travel credit for future use (minus cancellation fees). Refunds typically take 7 business days for credit/debit card payments or 20 business days for bank transfers or other methods.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.42857142857142855,0.7756703736859004,0.5714285714285714,0.53,1.0
