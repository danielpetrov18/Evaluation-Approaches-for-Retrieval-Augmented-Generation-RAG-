    "\n",
    "An evaluation sample is a single structured data instance that is used to assess and measure the performance of your LLM application in specific scenarios. It represents a single unit of interaction or a specific use case that the AI application is expected to handle. In Ragas, evaluation samples are represented using the `SingleTurnSample` and `MultiTurnSample` classes.\n",

    "This type of sample is ideal for straightforward question-answering scenarios where a user asks a single question and expects a direct response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MultiTurnSample\n",

    "`MultiTurnSample` represents a multi-turn interaction between Human, AI and optionally a Tool and expected results for evaluation. It is suitable for representing conversational agents in more complex interactions for evaluation.\n",
