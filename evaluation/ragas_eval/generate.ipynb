    "### Definition of evaluation sample\n",
    "\n",
    "An evaluation sample is a single structured data instance that is used to assess and measure the performance of your LLM application in specific scenarios. It represents a single unit of interaction or a specific use case that the AI application is expected to handle. In Ragas, evaluation samples are represented using the `SingleTurnSample` and `MultiTurnSample` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SingleTurnSample\n",
    "\n",
    "`SingleTurnSample` represents a single-turn interaction between a user, LLM, and expected results for evaluation. It is suitable for evaluations that involve a single question and answer pair, possibly with additional context or reference information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of sample is ideal for straightforward question-answering scenarios where a user asks a single question and expects a direct response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MultiTurnSample\n",
    "\n",
    "`MultiTurnSample` represents a multi-turn interaction between Human, AI and optionally a Tool and expected results for evaluation. It is suitable for representing conversational agents in more complex interactions for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `MultiTurnSample`, the `user_input` attribute represents a sequence of messages that collectively form a multi-turn conversation between a human user and an AI system. These messages are instances of the classes `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, and `ToolMessage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of sample is designed for evaluating more complex conversational flows where multiple turns of dialogue occur, potentially involving tool usage for gathering additional information.\n",
