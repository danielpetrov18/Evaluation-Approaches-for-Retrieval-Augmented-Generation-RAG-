A relevant statement should be a direct response to the input, should stay on-topic and should fully answer the input question.

The `verdict` key should STRICTLY be either a 'yes', 'idk' or 'no'.
- 'yes' if the statement is relevant to addressing the original input
- 'no' if the statement is irrelevant
- 'idk' if it is ambiguous (eg., not directly relevant but could be used as a supporting point to address the input).
